    "content": "Dear Naked Security readers,\n\nFirstly, thank you for your interest, your time, and your contributions to the Naked Security community. Your invaluable engagement and expertise have helped improve cybersecurity for everyone.\n\nWe have recently added the extensive catalog of Naked Security articles to the Sophos News blog platform, enabling us to provide all Sophos security research, insights, and intelligence in a single location.\n\nWe are redirecting articles from Naked Security to Sophos News and you can continue to access the Naked Security article library whenever you need it.\n\nAs adversary behaviors evolve, we’re seeing increased demand for deep threat research to help defenders keep pace with today’s fast-changing, innovative attacks. In response, we’re increasing our content focus on proprietary research by our Sophos X-Ops team.\n\nSophos X-Ops is a cross-functional team of more than 500 threat intelligence and security experts with visibility into attacker behaviors and other important topics including ransomware attacker trends, cluster attacks, software vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks, zero days, and much more. You can find their articles in the Security Operations, Threat Research and AI Research sections of this blog.\n\nWe’re extremely proud of Naked Security’s contributions to the security community over the last decade. Paul Ducklin will continue to share his security expertise on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.\n\nIf you don’t already, we invite you to subscribe to receive our Sophos News blog email (sign-up at the bottom of this page) and follow Sophos X-Ops on X (Twitter) and Mastodon.\n\nWhether you’re a threat hunter, security administrator, IT/security generalist, home user or more, we know you will find Sophos X-Ops a valuable resource.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nSophos"
