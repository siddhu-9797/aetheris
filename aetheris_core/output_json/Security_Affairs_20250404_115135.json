    "content": "Critical flaw in Apache Parquet’s Java Library allows remote code execution\n\nPierluigi Paganini April 04, 2025 April 04, 2025\n\nExperts warn of a critical vulnerability impacting Apache Parquet’s Java Library that could allow remote code execution.\n\nApache Parquet’s Java Library is a software library for reading and writing Parquet files in the Java programming language. Parquet is a columnar storage file format that is optimized for use with large-scale data processing frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Drill.\n\nExperts disclosed a critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-30065 (CVSS score of 10.0), impacting Apache Parquet’s Java Library that could allow remote code execution\n\n“Schema parsing in the parquet-avro module of Apache Parquet 1.15.0 and previous versions allows bad actors to execute arbitrary code” reads the advisory.\n\nThe vulnerability CVE-2025-30065 is a Deserialization of Untrusted Data issue. The flaw affects systems importing Parquet files, especially from untrusted sources, and can be exploited by attackers tampering with the files. Versions 1.15.0 and earlier are vulnerable, with the flaw traced back to version 1.8.0. This impacts big-data frameworks (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Flink) and custom applications using Parquet. Users should verify their software stack for this issue.\n\n“If an attacker tricks a vulnerable system into reading a specially crafted Parquet file, they could gain remote code execution (RCE) on that system​.” reads a report published by Endor Labs. “In practice, this might allow them to:\n\nTake control of the system: They could run any commands or software, effectively gaining control​.\n\nThey could run any commands or software, effectively gaining control​. Steal or tamper with data: Sensitive information could be accessed, copied, or modified.\n\nSensitive information could be accessed, copied, or modified. Install malware: The attacker might deploy ransomware, cryptominers, or other malicious software.\n\nThe attacker might deploy ransomware, cryptominers, or other malicious software. Disrupt services: They could shut down services or corrupt data, causing denial of service and business downtime.\n\n“All confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system are at risk (in CVSS terms, “High” impact on all three)​. Despite the frightening potential, it’s important to note that the vulnerability can only be exploited if a malicious Parquet file is imported.”\n\nAccording to Endor Labs, as of April 2025, there are no known active exploits for this vulnerability. However, with the issue now public, threat actors may attempt to exploit it. The researchers urge users to address the issue immediately.\n\nTo protect your systems from CVE-2025-30065, upgrade Apache Parquet Java to version 1.15.1 or later. If that’s not possible, avoid or validate Parquet files from untrusted sources and implement input validation. Enable monitoring and logging to detect suspicious behavior, and stay informed on updates from Apache or cybersecurity authorities. Applying these actions will reduce risks and protect your systems.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, Parquet’s Java Library)"

This activity is tracked under the identifier UAC-0219.\n\n“The Ukrainian government’s computer emergency response team, CERT-UA, is taking systematic measures to accumulate and analyze data on cyber incidents in order to provide up-to-date information on cyber threats.” reads the report published by CERT-UA. “Thus, during March 2025, at least three cyberattacks were recorded against government agencies and critical infrastructure facilities of Ukraine, aimed at collecting and stealing information from computers using appropriate software tools.”\n\nSince fall 2024, threat actor used compromised accounts to send emails with links (e.g., DropMeFiles, Google Drive) leading to VBScript loaders that download PowerShell scripts. These scripts search for sensitive files and take screenshots for exfiltration via cURL. Attackers used NSIS installers with decoy files and IrfanView. Notably, from 2025 onwards, the screenshot functionality shifted to being powered by PowerShell. Targets included file types like .doc, .pdf, .xls, .png, and more.\n\nThe primary tool used for stealing files, tracked as WRECKSTEEL, has versions in VBScript and PowerShell. Since the stealers are not persistent, any signs of cyberattacks should be reported to CERT-UA immediately for prompt cyber protection measures.\n\nThe report includes indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, newsletter)"

    "content": "39M secrets exposed: GitHub rolls out new security tools\n\nPierluigi Paganini April 04, 2025 April 04, 2025\n\n39 Million Secrets Leaked on GitHub in 2024\n\nGitHub found 39M secrets leaked in 2024 and launched new tools to help developers and organizations secure sensitive data in code.\n\nMicrosoft-owned code hosting platform GitHub announced the discovery of 39 million secrets leaked in 2024. The exposure of this sensitive information poses a serious risk to organizations, as malicious actors are ready to exploit it in attacks. Developers frequently expose secrets like API keys, often underestimating the risk. Attackers exploit even “low-risk” leaks for lateral movement. Storing secrets in git history increases vulnerability, and accidental public exposures hit record highs in 2024.\n\n“To give you an idea of the scope of the problem, more than 39 million secrets were leaked across GitHub in 2024 alone. Every minute GitHub blocks several secrets with push protection.” reads the report published by GitHub. “Still, secret leaks remain one of the most common—and preventable—causes of security incidents. As we develop code faster than ever previously imaginable, we’re leaking secrets faster than ever, too.”\n\nThe company launched new tools to help developers and organizations secure sensitive data in their code.\n\nGitHub launches new Advanced Security features, including standalone Secret Protection and Code Security, support for GitHub Team orgs, and free secret scanning. Secret Protection is free for public repositories.\n\nThe company now offers standalone security add-ons for Team organizations, eliminating the need for Enterprise upgrades. To prevent leaks, GitHub enables Team and Enterprise users to run secret risk assessments across all repositories, enhancing security.\n\nSecret Protection is free for public repositories. The company states that identifying exposed secrets is crucial.\n\n“The secret risk assessment is a point-in-time scan leveraging our scanning engine for organizations, covering all repositories–public, private, internal, and even archived–and can be run without purchase. The point-in-time scan provides clear insights into the exposure of your secrets across your organization, along with actionable steps to strengthen your security and protect your code.” concludes the report. “In order to lower barriers for organizations to use and benefit from the feature, no specific secrets are stored or shared.” GitHub notes.\n\nGitHub Advanced Security introduces major updates to enhance secret protection and code security. Now available as standalone products, these tools no longer require a full GitHub Advanced Security license, making them more accessible to smaller teams.\n\nGitHub has also enhanced push protection with delegated bypass controls, allowing organizations to define who can override security measures, adding policy-level enforcement. AI-powered secret detection using GitHub Copilot improves accuracy by identifying unstructured secrets like passwords, reducing false positives.\n\nTo further strengthen security, GitHub has partnered with cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and OpenAI to improve secret detection and response times.\n\nThe Microsoft-owned company also recommends best practices such as enabling Push Protection, eliminating hardcoded secrets, and using secret managers, environment variables, or CI/CD-integrated tools to reduce human error and exposure risks.\n\nThese updates aim to make security more accessible and improve secret management across repositories.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, secure coding)"

The vulnerability has been exploited by a China-linked threat actor since at least mid-March 2025.\n\nIvanti did not disclose details about the attack, however cybersecurity experts at Mandiant and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) linked the exploration attempts to an alleged China-linked cyberespionage group tracked as UNC5221.\n\nThe vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow that allows remote unauthenticated remote code execution.\n\nThe flaw impacts Ivanti Connect Secure (version 22.7R2.5 and earlier), Pulse Connect Secure 9.x (end-of-support as of December 31, 2024), Ivanti Policy Secure and ZTA gateways. The software company addressed the vulnerability with the release of Connect Secure 22.7R2.6 (released February 11, 2025).\n\n“We are aware of a limited number of customers whose Ivanti Connect Secure (22.7R2.5 and earlier) and End-of-Support Pulse Connect Secure 9.1x appliances have been exploited at the time of disclosure.” reads the advisory published by the company. “The vulnerability is a buffer overflow with characters limited to periods and numbers, it was evaluated and determined not to be exploitable as remote code execution and didn’t meet the requirements of denial of service. However, Ivanti and our security partners have now learned the vulnerability is exploitable through sophisticated means and have identified evidence of active exploitation in the wild. We encourage all customers to ensure they are running Ivanti Connect Secure 22.7R2.6 as soon as possible, which remediates the vulnerability.”\n\nIvanti will release security patches for ZTA and Policy Secure gateways on April 19 and 21. No exploits are known yet, but admins should monitor ICT logs and reset compromised devices.\n\nIvanti urges admins to monitor Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) for web server crashes and reset compromised devices before redeploying them with version 22.7R2.6.\n\nAccording to Google GTIG, threat actor UNC5221 exploited the flaw since March 2025 to deploy TRAILBLAZE and BRUSHFIRE malware, along with SPAWN malware.\n\nThe earliest evidence of observed CVE-2025-22457 exploitation occurred in mid-March 2025. Following successful exploitation, we observed the deployment of two newly identified malware families, the TRAILBLAZE in-memory only dropper and the BRUSHFIRE passive backdoor. Additionally, deployment of the previously reported SPAWN ecosystem of malware attributed to UNC5221 was also observed. UNC5221 is a suspected China-nexus espionage actor that we previously observed conducting zero-day exploitation of edge devices dating back to 2023.\n\n“Following successful exploitation, we observed the deployment of two newly identified malware families, the TRAILBLAZE in-memory only dropper and the BRUSHFIRE passive backdoor,” reads the Google’s report.. “Additionally, deployment of the previously reported SPAWN ecosystem of malware attributed to UNC5221 was also observed.”\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, UNC5221)"

    "content": "Europol-led operation shuts down CSAM platform Kidflix, leading to 79 arrests\n\nPierluigi Paganini April 03, 2025 April 03, 2025\n\nAn international law enforcement operation shuts down Kidflix, a child sexual abuse material (CSAM) streaming platform with 1.8M users.\n\nAn international operation, codenamed Operation Stream, against child sexual exploitation shuts down one of the largest streaming platforms that offered child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in the world, Kidflix.\n\nThe investigation was led by the State Criminal Police of Bavaria (Bayerisches Landeskriminalamt) and the Bavarian Central Office for the Prosecution of Cybercrime (ZCB) with the support of Europol. According to Europol, over 35 countries worldwide participated in the operation.\n\nKidflix had 1.8M users, German and Dutch officials seized its server on March 11, 2025. The operation, which has been ongoing since 2022, identified 1,393 suspects, arrested 79, and seized over 3,000 devices. The authorities confirmed that some suspects also abused children. The investigation has protected 39 children.\n\n“A total of 1.8 million users worldwide logged on to the platform between April 2022 and March 2025. On 11 March 2025, the server, which contained around 72 000 videos at the time, was seized by German and Dutch authorities.” reads the press release published by Europol. “The investigation resulted in the identification of almost 1 400 suspects worldwide. So far, 79 of these individuals have been arrested for sharing and distributing child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Some of those arrested not only uploaded and watched videos but also abused children. The investigation is ongoing.”\n\nKidflix, launched in 2021, rapidly became a major CSAM platform, generating huge profits. Users uploaded 91,000 videos, totaling 6,288 hours, with 3.5 new videos added per hour. Unlike other platforms, Kidflix allowed streaming and used cryptocurrency-based payments. Offenders earned tokens by uploading and categorizing content, which they used to access higher-quality versions. Authorities have since shut it down.\n\n“Unlike other known platforms of this kind, Kidflix not only enabled users to download CSAM but also to stream video files. Users made payments using cryptocurrencies, which were subsequently converted into tokens. By uploading CSAM, verifying video titles and descriptions and assigning categories to videos, offenders could earn tokens, which were then used to view content.” continues the press release. “Each video was uploaded in multiple versions – low, medium and high quality – allowing criminals to preview the content and pay a fee to unlock higher quality versions.”\n\n“The digital dimension has driven a rapid evolution in online child sexual exploitation, offering offenders a borderless platform to contact and groom victims, as well as to create, store, and exchange child sexual abuse material.” said Catherine De Bolle, Europol Executive Director. “Some attempt to frame this as merely a technical or cyber issue – but it is not. There are real victims behind these crimes, and those victims are children. As a society, we must act to protect our children.”\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, newsletter)"

    "content": "New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\nPierluigi Paganini April 03, 2025 April 03, 2025\n\nA new Triada trojan variant comes preinstalled on Android devices, stealing data on setup, warn researchers from Kaspersky.\n\nKaspersky researchers discovered a new Triada trojan variant preinstalled on thousands of Android devices, enabling data theft upon setup. Kaspersky detected 2,600+ infections in Russia from March 13-27, 2025.\n\nThe malware was discovered on counterfeit Android devices mimicking popular smartphone models. The researchers speculate that threat actors behind this variant have compromised the supply chain, so stores may not even suspect that they are selling smartphones infected with Triada\n\n“The new version of the malware is distributed in the firmware of infected Android devices. It is located in the system framework. This means that a copy of Triada gets into every process on the smartphone.” reads the report published by Kaspersky. “The malware has broad functionality and gives attackers almost unlimited control over the gadget”\n\nThe malware, embedded in the system framework, provides attackers full control over the device. It can steal accounts, send messages, steal crypto, monitor browsing, intercept SMS, and more.\n\n“the authors of the new version of Triada are actively monetizing their efforts. Judging by the analysis of transactions, they were able to transfer about $270,000 in various cryptocurrencies*** to their crypto wallets.” said Dmitry Kalinin, a cybersecurity expert at Kaspersky Lab. “However, in reality, this amount may be larger; the attackers also targeted Monero, a cryptocurrency that is untraceable.”\n\nTo protect against malware, experts recommend buying smartphones from authorized distributors and installing security solutions like Kaspersky for Android immediately.\n\nIn March 2018, security researchers at Antivirus firm Dr.Web discovered that 42 models of low-cost Android smartphones were shipped with the Android.Triada.231 banking malware.\n\nThe Triada Trojan was spotted for the first time in 2016 by researchers at Kaspersky Lab who considered it the most advanced mobile threat seen to the date of the discovery.\n\nTriada was designed with the specific intent to implement financial frauds, typically hijacking financial SMS transactions. The most interesting characteristic of the Triada Trojan is its modular architecture, which gives it theoretically a wide range of abilities.\n\nThe Triada Trojan makes use of the Zygote parent process to implement its code in the context of all software on the device, this means that the threat is able to run in each application.\n\nThe only way to remove the threat is to wipe the smartphone and reinstall the OS.\n\nResearchers at Dr.Web discovered the Triada Trojan pre-installed on newly shipped devices of several minor brands, including Advan, Cherry Mobile, Doogee, and Leagoo.\n\nIn July 2017, Dr..Web researchers discovered many smartphone models were shipped with the dreaded Triada trojan such as Leagoo M5 Plus, Leagoo M8, Nomu S10, and Nomu S20.\n\nThe experts who investigated the issue discovered that a software developer from Shanghai was responsible for the infection.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)"

    "content": "New advanced FIN7’s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\nPierluigi Paganini April 02, 2025 April 02, 2025\n\nFIN7 cybercrime group has been linked to Anubis, a Python-based backdoor that provides remote access to compromised Windows systems.\n\nThe threat actor FIN7, also known as Savage Ladybug, has developed a new Python-based malware, named Anubis Backdoor, which allows attackers to gain full remote control over infected Windows systems. It executes shell commands and system operations while using obfuscation to evade detection. Delivered via phishing and hosted on compromised SharePoint sites, it remains undetected by most antivirus solutions, posing a serious security risk.\n\n“The malware is distributed as a ZIP package, which includes a single Python script alongside multiple Python executables. Some variants execute the obfuscated payload immediately after writing it to disk, while others load the payload and call a specific function from it.” reads the report published by cybersecurity firm PRODAFT. “This variability in execution methods demonstrates the malware’s adaptability and the threat actor’s efforts to diversify their delivery mechanisms for different operational scenarios.”\n\nFIN7 is a Russian criminal group (aka Carbanak) that has been active since mid-2015, it focuses on restaurants, gambling, and hospitality industries in the US to harvest financial information that was used in attacks or sold in cybercrime marketplaces.\n\nThe researchers noted that a Python script with ~30 lines serves as the main entry point, decrypting and executing the real payload. The backdoor, targeting Windows, uses AES-CBC encryption with base64 encoding and loads the payload via the exec function. Its obfuscation method, replacing variable names with similar characters, resembles tools like PyObfuscate or Anubis Obfuscator, making analysis harder but not highly complex.\n\nThe backdoor communicates via a single TCP socket, switching servers if one fails. Messages, including the groupname, are base64-encoded. Upon execution, it sends the process ID and local IP to the C2 server. To determine the local IP, it creates a UDP socket to 8.8.8.8 on port 80, letting the OS resolve the appropriate address without actual traffic. Each payload contains a groupname and two IPs for communication.\n\nThe backdoor supports multiple commands, including retrieving IP, modifying the registry, executing Python code, and loading DLLs into memory. Remote code execution allows the malware to load malicious functionalities dynamically. The malware supports functionalities like keylogging, file transfers, and registry modifications. It continuously processes commands until termination, using subprocess.Popen for shell execution.\n\n“AnubisBackdoor is a stealthy Python-based tool used by Savage Ladybug (FIN7) to maintain access to compromised systems. Despite its mild obfuscation, it remains fully undetected (FUD) by most antivirus solutions. Delivered via malspam campaigns, with compromised SharePoint instances serving the payload, it poses a significant threat to enterprise environments.” concludes the report. “Variants of the backdoor execute the payload differently, suggesting ongoing refinement by attackers.”\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, Anubis backdoor)"

    "content": "U.S. CISA adds Apache Tomcat flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\nPierluigi Paganini April 02, 2025 April 02, 2025\n\nU.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds Apache Tomcat flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added an Apache Tomcat path equivalence vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24813, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.\n\nThe Apache Tomcat vulnerability CVE-2025-24813 was recently disclosed and is being actively exploited just 30 hours after a public PoC was released.\n\nThe issue is a path equivalence flaw in Apache Tomcat that allows remote code execution or information disclosure if specific conditions are met. The vulnerability affects multiple versions including 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.34, and 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.98. Exploitation requires write-enabled default servlet, partial PUT support, and specific file handling conditions.\n\n“The original implementation of partial PUT used a temporary file based on the user provided file name and path with the path separator replaced by “.”.” reads the advisory.\n\n“If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to view security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files:\n\nwrites enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)\n\nsupport for partial PUT (enabled by default)\n\na target URL for security sensitive uploads that is a sub-directory of a target URL for public uploads\n\nattacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files being uploaded\n\nthe security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUT\n\nIf all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to perform remote code execution:\n\nwrites enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)\n\nsupport for partial PUT (enabled by default)\n\napplication was using Tomcat’s file based session persistence with the default storage location\n\napplication included a library that may be leveraged in a deserialization attack”\n\nTomcat versions 9.0.99, 10.1.35, and 11.0 addressed the vulnerability.\n\nWallarm researchers confirmed active exploitation of the flaw and added that attackers can hijack Apache Tomcat servers with a single PUT API request. PoC is online.\n\n“A devastating new remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, CVE-2025-24813, is now actively exploited in the wild. ” reads the advisory published by Wallarm. “Attackers need just one PUT API request to take over vulnerable Apache Tomcat servers. The exploit, originally published by a Chinese forum user iSee857, is already available online: CVE-2025-24813 PoC by iSee857.”\n\nThe attack exploits Tomcat’s session persistence and partial PUT requests by uploading a malicious Java session file and triggering deserialization via a GET request.\n\nThe attack involves two steps:\n\nUploading a Malicious Serialized Session – The attacker sends a PUT request containing a base64-encoded ysoserial gadget chain, storing it in Tomcat’s session directory. Triggering Execution via Session Cookie – A GET request with the JSESSIONID referencing the malicious session forces Tomcat to deserialize and execute the payload, granting remote access.\n\n“This attack is dead simple to execute and requires no authentication. The only requirement is that Tomcat is using file-based session storage, which is common in many deployments.” concludes the advisory. “Worse, base64 encoding allows the exploit to bypass most traditional security filters, making detection challenging.”\n\nWallarm researchers warn that most Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) fail to detect this attack because the PUT request appears normal and lacks obvious malicious content. The payload is base64-encoded, evading pattern-based detection, and the attack occurs in two steps, with execution happening only during deserialization. Additionally, most WAFs do not thoroughly inspect uploaded files or track multi-step exploits. As a result, by the time organizations notice the breach in their logs, it is already too late.\n\nUsers are recommended to update their affected Tomcat versions immediately to mitigate potential threats.\n\nAccording to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix this vulnerability by April 22, 2025.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, CISA)"

The vulnerability is a privilege escalation vulnerability that impacts the Core Media framework. The Apple Core Media framework supports multimedia tasks like playback, recording, and manipulation of audio and video on iOS and macOS devices. The company addressed the use-after-free issue with improved memory management.\n\nCVE-2025-24200 (CVSS score: 4.6) – In February, Apple released emergency security updates to address a zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24200, that the company believes was exploited in “extremely sophisticated” targeted attacks. An attacker could have exploited the vulnerability to disable the USB Restricted Mode “on a locked device.” Apple’s USB Restricted Mode is a security feature introduced in iOS 11.4.1 to protect devices from unauthorized access via the Lightning port. The USB Restricted Mode disables the data connection of the iPhone’s Lightning port after a specific interval of time, but it doesn’t interrupt the charging process. Any other data transfer would require the user to provide the passcode. The IT giant fixed the vulnerability with improved state management.\n\nCVE-2025-24201 (CVSS score: 8.8) – In March, Apple released emergency security updates to address a zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24201, in the WebKit cross-platform web browser engine. The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write issue that was exploited in “extremely sophisticated” attacks. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability using maliciously crafted web content to escape the Web Content sandbox. Apple released this fix as an additional measure after blocking a similar attack in iOS 17.2.\n\nApple released the following updates:\n\nthat are available for the following devices:\n\niOS 15.8.4 and iPadOS 15.8.4 – iPhone 6s (all models), iPhone 7 (all models), iPhone SE (1st generation), iPad Air 2, iPad mini (4th generation), and iPod touch (7th generation)\n\niOS 16.7.11 and iPadOS 16.7.11 – iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad 5th generation, iPad Pro 9.7-inch, and iPad Pro 12.9-inch 1st generation\n\niPadOS 17.7.6 – iPad Pro 12.9-inch 2nd generation, iPad Pro 10.5-inch, and iPad 6th generation\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, newsletter)"

It allows advertisers to track user activity across apps and websites for targeted advertising while maintaining user anonymity. Users can reset or disable IDFA through privacy settings.\n\nFrance’s Autorité found Apple’s ATT framework, while not inherently problematic, was implemented in a way that was unnecessary and disproportionate. Apple’s ATT framework caused excessive pop-ups, complicating third-party app use. It lacked neutrality and harmed smaller publishers reliant on third-party data, leading to economic disadvantages for app developers and ad service providers.\n\n“As part of its investigation into the merits of the case, the Autorité found that while the objective of the App Tracking Transparency (“ATT”) framework is not at its core problematic, how ATT is implemented is neither necessary for nor proportionate with Apple’s stated objective of protecting personal data.” reads the report published by France’s Autorité de la concurrence.\n\nApple’s ATT framework, though intended for privacy, was found to unfairly disadvantage third-party apps by making their use overly complex and favoring Apple’s own services. The Autorité ruled that ATT’s implementation distorted competition, harming smaller publishers reliant on ad revenue. Apple also imposed stricter consent rules on others while benefiting from a simpler process for its own data collection. The framework’s asymmetry, where Apple required double consent from third-party apps but not itself, led to regulatory penalties. The Autorité considered these rules unnecessary, as they harmed competition and made third-party apps more difficult to use without valid reasoning.\n\nThe head of the French Competition Authority dismissed worries that the decision would prompt retaliation from U.S. President Donald Trump who has threatened to slap fines on EU countries fining U.S. companies.\n\n“We apply competition law in an apolitical manner,” Benoit Coeure, the head of the French Competition Authority, told a press conference. “But what we have heard … is that they (U.S. authorities) intend to apply antitrust law to the big digital platforms as strictly as their predecessors. So in terms of antitrust, I don’t see any controversy between the United States and Europe on how we apply the law,” he added.\n\nApple expressed disappointment with the decision, noting that the French Competition Authority did not mandate any specific changes to the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.\n\n“While we are disappointed with today’s decision, the French Competition Authority has not required any specific changes to ATT,” reads a statement issued by the IT giant.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, Ukraine)"

    "content": "Hiding WordPress malware in the mu-plugins directory to avoid detection\n\nPierluigi Paganini April 01, 2025 April 01, 2025\n\nSucuri researchers spotted threat actors deploying WordPress malware in the mu-plugins directory to evade security checks.\n\nIn February, Sucuri warned of threat actors exploiting WordPress mu-plugins, which auto-load without activation, to maintain persistence and evade detection by hiding backdoors in the plugin directory.\n\n“Unlike regular plugins, must-use plugins are automatically loaded on every page load, without needing activation or appearing in the standard plugin list. Attackers exploit this directory to maintain persistence and evade detection, as files placed here execute automatically and are not easily disabled from the WordPress admin panel.” states Sucuri. “This makes it an ideal location for backdoors, allowing attackers to execute malicious code stealthily.”\n\nAttackers used obfuscated PHP in mu-plugins to execute hidden payloads from /wp-content/uploads/2024/12/index.txt , using the functions eval() to run arbitrary code stealthily.\n\nThe script constructs a URL, sends requests to an external server, fetches content via file_get_contents() or cURL, modifies robots.txt , checks response markers, and pings sitemaps. The researchers noted that the script can manipulate website behavior, evade detection, and facilitate redirections.\n\nThe experts detailed two cases of malware hiding in the mu-plugins directory, which use different methods to compromise WordPress sites.\n\nMalware in the mu-plugins directory includes a fake update redirect ( redirect.php ), a webshell ( index.php ) for full site control, and a spam injector ( custom-js-loader.php ). These malware allow attackers to redirect users, execute arbitrary code, and inject spam, aligning with past findings on hidden backdoors in WordPress sites.\n\n“The presence of this malware can be identified by most obvious signs. One prominent indicator is unusual behavior on the site, such as unauthorized redirections of users to external malicious websites. Additionally, suspicious files with uncommon or misleading names appear within the mu-plugins directory, often mimicking legitimate plugins.” reads the report published by Sucuri. “Website administrators may also notice elevated server resource usage with no clear explanation, along with unexpected file modifications or the inclusion of unauthorized code in critical directories.”\n\nAttackers increasingly target the mu-plugins directory for persistence, as it auto-loads plugins without activation. This allows them to redirect traffic, maintain backdoor access, and inject spam for SEO manipulation, making it hard to detect and remove.\n\nThe first malware analyzed by Sucuri is a fake update redirection malware in redirect.php that selectively redirects visitors to a malicious site while avoiding bots and admins to evade detection. Disguised as a WordPress function, it tricks users into executing malicious code, leading to data theft, backdoors, and further infections, compromising site security.\n\nThe second malware is a Remote Code Execution Webshell. A sophisticated attack in index.php disguises itself as a plugin, using cURL to fetch and execute a remote PHP script. This allows attackers to inject new malware dynamically without altering the file, enabling persistent control and ongoing infections.\n\nThe third malware detected by Sucurity is a JavaScript injector in custom-js-loader.php that replaces site images with explicit content and hijacks links to open malicious popups. It ensures persistence in the mu-plugins folder, harming the site’s reputation and user experience while manipulating traffic for malicious purposes.\n\nThe infections discovered by the researchers aim for monetization and persistence. Redirect malware harms reputation and traffic, the webshell enables full site takeover and data theft, and spam injection replaces images with explicit content while hijacking links. Impacts range from SEO spam to severe security breaches, stressing the need for strong security.\n\nAttackers may have deployed the malware through vulnerable plugins/themes, compromised admin credentials, or poorly secured hosting, allowing attackers to upload and execute malicious files.\n\n“The repeated abuse of the mu-plugins directory highlights the creativity and persistence of attackers in hiding malware deep within WordPress installations.” concludes the report. “Regular security monitoring, file integrity checks, and web application firewalls (WAFs) are essential in keeping such infections at bay.”\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, mu-plugins)"

Attackers can exploit the backdoor to access sensitive log files. While no active exploitation was initially observed, the publication of exploit details has led to recent attack activity.\n\n“Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Smart Licensing Utility could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to collect sensitive information or administer Cisco Smart Licensing Utility services on a system while the software is running.” reads the advisory.\n\nBelow are the descriptions of the two vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2024-20439 (CVSS score: 9.8) – The flaw is related to the presence of an undocumented static admin credential, allowing attackers to log in with administrative privileges via the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility API.\n\n(CVSS score: 9.8) – The flaw is related to the presence of an undocumented static admin credential, allowing attackers to log in with administrative privileges via the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility API. CVE-2024-20440 (CVSS score: 9.8) – The vulnerability is due to excessive verbosity in a debug log file. An attacker could exploit this issue by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to an affected device and obtain log files that contain sensitive data, including credentials that can be used to access the API.\n\nThe IT giant also released software updates that address these flaws. There are no workarounds to address the two issues.\n\nResearchers at SANS Internet Storm Center warned that the two issues are actively exploited in attacks.\n\n“These two vulnerabilities are somewhat connected. The first one is one of the many backdoors Cisco likes to equip its products with. A simple fixed password that can be used to obtain access. The second one is a log file that logs more than it should. Using the first vulnerability, an attacker may access the log file.” reads the advisory published by SANS. “A quick search didn’t show any active exploitation, but details, including the backdoor credentials, were published in a blog by Nicholas Starke shortly after Cisco released its advisory [2]. So it is no surprise that we are seeing some exploit activity”\n\nSANS researchers warned that the group attempting to exploit the two vulnerabilities is also targeting configuration files and possibly CVE-2024-0305 (CVSS score: 5.3), likely exploiting a DVR vulnerability.\n\nSANS’s advisory does not provide information about the identity or motivation of the attackers exploiting the two flaws.\n\nAccording to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix this vulnerability by April 21, 2025.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, Cisco Smart Licensing Utility vulnerability)"

Armageddon, Primitive Bear, ACTINIUM, Callisto) targets Ukraine with a phishing campaign. The cyberespionage group is behind a long series of spear-phishing attacks targeting Ukrainian entities, and organizations related to Ukrainian affairs. The APT group has been launching cyber-espionage campaigns against Ukraine since at least 2014.\n\nThe threat actor is using troop-related lures to deploy the Remcos RAT via PowerShell downloader.\n\nThe campaign has been active since at least November 2024, the PowerShell downloader connects to geo-fenced servers in Russia and Germany to retrieve a ZIP file with the Remcos backdoor.\n\n“Cisco Talos is actively tracking an ongoing campaign targeting users in Ukraine with malicious LNK files, which run a PowerShell downloader, since at least November 2024.” reads the Talos report. “The second stage payload uses DLL side loading to execute the Remcos payload. Talos assesses with medium confidence that this activity is associated with the Gamaredon threat actor group.”\n\nThreat actor distributes LNK files compressed inside ZIP archives as part of the recent phishing campaign, usually disguising the file as an Office document and uses names related to the military invasion.\n\nGamaredon likely sends phishing e-mails with either an attached ZIP file or that contain a URL link pointing to the file hosted on a remote host.\n\nThe malicious LNK files, created on two machines, contain PowerShell code to download the next stage payload and a decoy file to disguise the infection.\n\nThe PowerShell code avoids antivirus detection by using Get-Command to execute the payload. The researchers noticed that the servers only responded to requests from Ukraine, while connections from Germany and Russia return HTTP 403 errors, possibly restricting access to Ukrainian victims. Evidence shows the servers were still hosting files for specific regions.\n\nGamaredon typically uses custom scripts and tools but has recently been observed employing the Remcos backdoor in their campaigns. The attack involves downloading a ZIP payload from servers, extracting it to the %TEMP% folder, and executing a seemingly clean application that loads a malicious DLL via DLL sideloading. This DLL acts as a loader, decrypting and executing the final Remcos payload from encrypted files within the ZIP.\n\nThe PowerShell scripts used to download the ZIP files suggest abuse of legitimate applications for DLL sideloading and contain a mix of clean and malicious files.\n\n“We can see in the previously mentioned sample downloaded by “Any.run” that it contains the clean application TivoDiag.exe, as well as two DLLs. The file “mindclient.dll” is the malicious DLL which is loaded by “TivoDiag.exe” during execution.” continues the report.\n\nThe report includes Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for this threat along with Snort rules for its detection.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, Ukraine)"

    "content": "CoffeeLoader uses a GPU-based packer to evade detection\n\nPierluigi Paganini March 31, 2025 March 31, 2025\n\nCoffeeLoader is a sophisticated malware that uses numerous techniques to bypass security solutions, Zscaler ThreatLabz warns.\n\nZscaler ThreatLabz discovered CoffeeLoader, a malware family active since September 2024, that uses multiple techniques to evade endpoint security while downloading second-stage payloads. The advanced techniques used by the malware include GPU-based packing, call stack spoofing, sleep obfuscation, and Windows fibers. CoffeeLoader is distributed via SmokeLoader, with which it shares behavioral similarities.\n\n“CoffeeLoader implements a number of features to defeat endpoint security software such as call stack spoofing, sleep obfuscation, and the use of Windows fibers.” reads the report published by Zscaler. “The loader leverages a packer, which we named Armoury, that executes code on a system’s GPU to hinder analysis in virtual environments.”\n\nCoffeeLoader uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) if the primary command and control servers are unavailable.\n\nThreatLabz researchers reported that the malware is being used to deploy Rhadamanthys info-stealer.\n\nThe samples are protected by a unique malware packer that utilizes a system’s GPU to execute code, making analysis in virtual environments more difficult. Experts have been tracking this packer as Armoury because it impersonates the legitimate Armoury Crate utility developed by ASUS.\n\nThe CoffeeLoader dropper executes an installation routine, with multiple variants implementing different functionalities. One version copies the packed DLL (ArmouryAIOSDK.dll) to the user’s temp directory and executes it via rundll32.exe, using either direct execution (with elevated privileges) or a UAC bypass (if not elevated). The researchers noted that this variant does not maintain persistence.\n\nOther versions achieve persistence by copying the DLL to %PROGRAMDATA% (with elevated privileges) or %LOCALAPPDATA% (without), setting restrictive file permissions, and scheduling a task (AsusUpdateServiceUA) via schtasks.exe or the Windows ITaskScheduler COM interface. Older versions schedule execution on user logon, while recent ones set it to run every 10 minutes.\n\nOnce installation is complete, the dropper executes CoffeeLoader’s stager component and exits.\n\nThe malware stager creates a suspended dllhost.exe process and injects the main CoffeeLoader module using NtAllocateVirtualMemory, NtProtectVirtualMemory, and NtWriteVirtualMemory. It modifies the thread context to execute the injected code before terminating.\n\nThe main module resolves API functions using the DJB2 algorithm and employs advanced evasion techniques, including call stack spoofing, sleep obfuscation, and Windows fibers.\n\n“The main CoffeeLoader module also resolves API function addresses by hash, but uses the DJB2 algorithm.” continues the report. “The main module implements numerous techniques to evade detection by antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDRs) including call stack spoofing, sleep obfuscation, and leveraging Windows fibers.”\n\nCoffeeLoader supports several commands that enable it to inject and execute shellcode, executables, and DLLs. These commands include sleeping (0x58), injecting and running shellcode in a specified process (0x87), updating the sleep obfuscation method and timeout (0x89), writing an executable payload to the user’s temporary directory and running it (0x91), and writing a DLL payload to the temporary directory and executing it using rundll32.exe (0x93).\n\nThe malware supports call stack spoofing to mask its function call origins, evading security tools that analyze stack traces. It sets up synthetic stack frames and maps system calls dynamically, avoiding user-mode hooks.\n\nFor sleep obfuscation, CoffeeLoader encrypts its memory while inactive, decrypting only during execution. It also bypasses Windows Control Flow Guard (CFG) by modifying memory permissions and adding exceptions for key system functions.\n\nThreatLabz identified several similarities between CoffeeLoader and SmokeLoader, suggesting a possible connection between the two malware. Both malware families use a stager to inject a main module into another process, generate a bot ID based on system details, and create a mutex name linked to the bot ID. They resolve imports using hashing, store internal variables in a global structure, and encrypt network traffic with hardcoded RC4 keys. The two malware also rely heavily on low-level Windows APIs and modify file attributes to remain hidden. They use scheduled tasks for persistence, with CoffeeLoader’s latest version running tasks every 10 minutes without elevated privileges. In December 2024, a new SmokeLoader version was allegedly announced, sharing many evasion techniques with CoffeeLoader. However, it remains unclear whether CoffeeLoader is an evolution of SmokeLoader or if the similarities are coincidental.\n\n“CoffeeLoader joins a crowded market of malware loaders. However, many of the features implemented by the author enable CoffeeLoader to contend with the competition. The loader provides advanced features that are beneficial to threat groups that strive to evade detection from AVs, EDRs, and malware sandboxes.” concludes the report that includes Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs). “The CoffeeLoader developer has integrated innovative offensive red team proof-of-concept ideas such as call stack spoofing, sleep obfuscation, and Windows fibers into the loader. There are also notable similarities between SmokeLoader and CoffeeLoader, with the former distributing the latter, but the exact relationship between the two malware families is not yet clear.”\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, ,malware)"

    "content": "Morphing Meerkat phishing kits exploit DNS MX records\n\nPierluigi Paganini March 31, 2025 March 31, 2025\n\nMorphing Meerkat phishing kits exploit DNS MX records to deliver spoofed login pages, targeting over 100 brands.\n\nInfoblox researchers discovered a new phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform that generated multiple phishing kits, called Morphing Meerkat, using DNS mail exchange (MX) records to deliver fake login pages and targeting over 100 brands.\n\nThreat actors are exploiting DNS techniques to enhance phishing attacks, using MX records to dynamically serve spoofed login pages. They also abuse open redirects, compromised domains, and distribute stolen credentials via Telegram.\n\nThe phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform behind Morphing Meerkat kits has been active for at least five years. It consistently employs the same tactics and core resources, yet its use of MX records for phishing has remained largely unreported.\n\nThe researchers believe that Morphing Meerkat has sent thousands of spam messages. Attackers sent messages from relatively centralized email servers, mainly belonging to internet service providers (ISPs) iomart (United Kingdom) and HostPapa (United States). The consistent tactics suggest a centralized phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform rather than multiple independent actors, as email activity is not widely distributed across providers.\n\nMorphing Meerkat enables large-scale phishing and spam campaigns, it uses compromised WordPress sites, open redirects, and MX records to tailor fake login pages. The platform bypasses security with obfuscated code, dynamic translations, and redirects suspicious users to real sites. Stolen credentials are distributed via email and chat.\n\n“We discovered cyber campaigns that used the phishing kits as early as January 2020. These early versions were only capable of serving phishing web templates disguised as five email brands: Gmail, Outlook, AOL, Office 365, and Yahoo. They also had no translation module, so the kits could only display English text in the phishing templates.” reads the report published by Infoblox. “Over time, Morphing Meerkat expanded the library of templates and we currently see 114 different brand designs. By July 2023 kits could dynamically load phishing pages based on DNS MX records. Today, the phishing kits can also dynamically translate text based on the victim’s web profile and target users in over a dozen different languages.”\n\nThe PhaaS platform sends spam emails with malicious links, targeting users globally, including high-profile professionals. The phishing kits use DNS MX records to serve dynamic login pages and can redirect victims to real sites for security evasion. Attackers adapt phishing pages into over a dozen languages using a JavaScript translation module, enabling large-scale attacks across different regions.\n\nPhishing emails use generic or spoofed logos, often impersonating banks or shipping services with scare tactics. To evade detection, they embed links in compromised sites, URL shorteners, and abuse DoubleClick’s open redirects.\n\nThe platform tailors phishing pages by dynamically loading HTML based on the victim’s email provider’s MX records, using Cloudflare and Google DNS over HTTPS.\n\nMorphing Meerkat exploits open redirects on ad tech platforms like Google DoubleClick, using fake domains and compromised sites. It queries the victim’s email domain’s MX record via DoH (Google/Cloudflare) to load a tailored phishing page with the email pre-filled for credibility.\n\nMorphing Meerkat’s PhaaS platform blocks security analysis, obfuscates code, and dynamically serves phishing pages based on DNS MX records. The platform supports more than 114 login templates and harvests credentials via email, PHP scripts, AJAX, or Telegram, often deleting evidence in real time.\n\nMorphing Meerkat exfiltrates stolen credentials via AJAX requests, PHP scripts, or Telegram bot webhooks. To ensure accuracy, victims see an “Invalid Password” error, prompting them to re-enter credentials. After submission, they are redirected to the legitimate login page to avoid suspicion.\n\n“Morphing Meerkat is another example of a long-running operation that is difficult to detect at scale. They know where security blind spots are and have been exploiting them via open redirects on adtech, DoH communication, and popular file sharing services.” concludes the report.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, phishing)"

Fraudsters used anonymous messaging apps to deceive victims into fake financial relationships. One Cleveland victim liquidated her retirement savings, sending over $650K in crypto to a fraudulent investment platform.\n\n“The FBI used blockchain intelligence to trace the flow of funds across multiple platforms and networks — from centralized exchanges, to Ethereum and TRON, through DeFi protocols, and into final storage wallets.” reads the report published by the blockchain cybersecurity firm TRM Labs. “Despite complex laundering methods, the investigation revealed common routing patterns and wallet reuse that helped agents piece together the full laundering scheme.”\n\nA romance baiting scam, aka pig butchering scam, is a type of financial fraud in which scammers build trust with victims over time, manipulating them into making large investments in fraudulent schemes.\n\nA pig butchering scam is a manipulative fraud where scammers build trust with victims over time, often via social media or dating apps, before exploiting them financially. They introduce fake investment opportunities, convincing victims to invest large sums. After convincing them with small returns, the scammer eventually locks accounts and disappears with the funds. The scam involves emotional manipulation, leaving victims financially devastated and reluctant to report the fraud.\n\nAccording to TRM Labs, the FBI uncovered laundering patterns tied to romance baiting scams, leading to a dual legal forfeiture for wire fraud and money laundering. Tether froze the funds in June 2024, burned the USDT tokens, and reissued them to law enforcement in November 2024. The seizure paves the way for restitution to victims, with the FBI tracing additional victims through seized wallets.\n\nThe complaint reveals that the scammer-controlled addresses contained funds from multiple pig butchering victims. The DOJ used dual legal theory to seize $8.2 million: funds tied to fraud were forfeited under wire fraud law, and remaining funds under money laundering law. This ensures restitution for known and unidentified victims as the FBI traces further addresses.\n\nPig butchering scams are rapidly growing crypto frauds, often connected to human trafficking in Southeast Asia. They exploit vulnerable individuals through financial grooming, causing significant damage.\n\n“First employed by Chinese organized crime groups, the particular type of investment fraud scheme detailed below initially targeted victims inside China then expanded worldwide during the global pandemic.” reads the complaint. “Operating from compounds in Cambodia and Myanmar, these criminal syndicates often operate by forcing human trafficking victims in Southeast Asia to participate in the schemes against their will. The schemes take advantage of the ability of cryptocurrency to be transferred securely and globally, without intermediaries and the safeguards established, and inherent to, the traditional financial system.”\n\n“This case underscores how public-private partnerships, sophisticated tracing tools, and smart legal strategies can lead to real-world impact. It’s not just about seizing crypto — it’s about getting justice for victims, many of whom lose their life savings.” concludes TRM.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, romance baiting)"

The Trojan has been active since 2016, it initially targeted Brazil but expanded to Mexico, Portugal, and Spain since 2020.\n\nGrandoreiro is a modular backdoor that supports the following capabilities:\n\nKeylogging\n\nAuto-Updation for newer versions and modules\n\nWeb-Injects and restricting access to specific websites\n\nCommand execution\n\nManipulating windows\n\nGuiding the victim’s browser to a certain URL\n\nC2 Domain Generation via DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm)\n\nImitating mouse and keyboard movements\n\nForcepoint states that the large-scale phishing campaigns use VPS hosting and obfuscation to evade detection.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm uncovered a Grandoreiro campaign targeting users in Mexico, Argentina, and Spain via phishing emails impersonating tax agencies. Attackers use Contabo-hosted links to deliver obfuscated Visual Basic scripts and disguised EXE payloads for credential theft. Attackers also employ encrypted or password-protected files to evade security detection.\n\nThe phishing email contains malicious links that redirect users to VPS or dedicated servers hosted on Contabo, with subdomains like vmi\\d{7}[.]contaboserver[.]net. Clicking the “Download PDF” button leads to a zip payload from MediaFire. These subdomains change with each campaign, linked to specific virtual machines or servers on Contabo’s network.\n\nClicking the “Download PDF” button triggers a JavaScript function that checks the browser and platform, then retrieves a Mediafire URL from a PHP file to download a .zip file. The .zip often contains a password-protected, obfuscated VBS script. This script decodes a base64 stream, drops an EXE file in the system directory, and executes it using Wscript.shell.\n\nThe extracted 32-bit EXE file is compiled with Delphi, it masquerades as a PDF and triggers an Acrobat Reader error. Upon user interaction, it connects to a C2 server (18.212.216.95) and searches for personal data, including Bitcoin files, system GUID, computer name, and language settings. The malware uses a custom URI Client and unusual port numbers to communicate with the server.\n\n“The attack involves malicious ZIP files containing obfuscated VBS scripts that drop a Delphi-based EXE. Once executed, the malware steals credentials, searches for Bitcoin wallet directories connects to a C2 server, Attackers frequently change subdomains under contaboserver[.]net to evade detection.” concludes the report that includes Indicators of compromise (IoCs).\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)"

Officers from the fraud prevention department of PJSC Sberbank assisted in the investigation.” reads the announcement published on Telegram by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD).\n\n“Preliminary findings indicate that the suspects developed malware called “Mamont,” which they distributed via Telegram channels under the guise of safe mobile applications and video files. Once a device was infected, the perpetrators could use SMS banking services to transfer money from victims’ bank cards to mobile operator accounts and electronic wallets under their control.”\n\nThe authorities linked the three suspects to over 300 cybercrimes, the police seized servers, computers, storage devices, and bank cards.\n\nMamont spreads via Telegram, Mamont malware is delivered through Telegram channels. Crooks typically disguise the malicious code as legitimate mobile apps or video files.\n\nMamont malware enables fund transfers via SMS banking, routing stolen money to phone numbers and electronic wallets controlled by criminals.\n\nThe malware can steal banking credentials, push notifications, and other financial information.\n\nMamont can also spread to contacts in the victim’s messenger app.\n\nScammers lure victims with fake online stores, directing them to a Telegram chat. They send a fake tracking app, which is actually Mamont malware, to steal banking data.\n\n“The attackers claim to sell various products at fairly attractive prices via number of websites. To make a purchase, the victim is asked to join a private Telegram messenger chat, where instructions for placing an order are posted. In essence, these instructions boil down to the fact that the victim needs to write a private message to the manager.” reads a report published by Kaspersky. “The channel itself exists to make the scheme look more convincing: participants of this chat ask clarifying questions, receive answers, and comment on things. Probably, there are both other victims of the same scheme and bots that create the appearance of active trading in this chat.”\n\nRussian authorities in Saratov have launched criminal cases under Articles 159.6 and 272 of the Criminal Code, blocking resources linked to the scheme. The suspects face travel restrictions and legal conduct orders.

In Q4 of last year, it increased its number of data leak posts by a staggering 1,425% quarter-on-quarter. According to independent reporting, the group has rapidly accelerated attacks and could become the most dominant RaaS group in 2025.\n\nResecurity has been covertly acquiring critical and previously undisclosed artifacts related to threat actors’ network infrastructure, logs, ISPs and hosting providers involved, timestamps of logins, associated file-sharing accounts at MEGA, the group created to store stolen data from the victims (which later got published via DLS in TOR). A successful compromise of BlackLock’s DLS allowed to uncover a trove of information about the threat actors and their Modus Operandi (MO), but more importantly, to predict and prevent some of their planned attacks and protect undisclosed victims by alerting them.\n\nResecurity identified 8 associated MEGA accounts used by the group to manage stolen victims’ data. Using rclone utility the actors were syncing the data between DLS and compromised environment exfiltrating data from enterprises.\n\nBlackLock is known as rebranding of El Dorado Ransomware. According to Resecurity, the same actors could be tied to several other prominent projects including Mamona Ransomware. The last project also did not last long. Karol Paciorek from CSIRT KNF identified a possible clearnet IP of Mamona DLS, which caused panic among affiliates.\n\nBoth BlackLock and Mamona Ransomware went offline and are currently not available. Notably, another prominent ransomware group DragonForce took the lead capitalizing on these events.

    "content": "Android malware campaigns use .NET MAUI to evade detection\n\nPierluigi Paganini March 25, 2025 March 25, 2025\n\nResearchers warn of a new Android malware that uses .NET MAUI to mimic legit services and evade detection.\n\nMcAfee researchers warn of Android malware campaigns using .NET MAUI to evade detection. These threats disguise themselves as legitimate services to steal sensitive information from users.\n\n.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is a cross-platform framework by Microsoft for building native mobile and desktop applications using C#. It allows developers to create apps that run on Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS from a single codebase, streamlining development and maintenance. It replaces Xamarin.Forms and provides a unified UI framework with platform-specific integrations.\n\nCybercriminals are using .NET MAUI to create Android malware that evades detection by hiding core functions in C# blob binaries instead of traditional DEX files.\n\nMcAfee researchers detailed a fake IndusInd Bank app targeting Indian users, stealing personal and banking data via a hidden malicious .NET MAUI payload.\n\n“Unlike typical malicious apps, there are no obvious traces of harmful code in the Java or native code.” reads the report published by McAfee. “Instead, the malicious code is hidden within blob files located inside the assemblies directory. “\n\nThen the collected data is sent to an attacker’s C2 server.\n\nAnother malware observed by the experts targets Chinese-speaking users, stealing contacts, SMS, and photos through third-party app stores. It evades detection using multi-stage dynamic loading, encrypting and loading its malicious payload in three steps.\n\nThe malware also manipulates AndroidManifest.xml with excessive permissions to disrupt analysis and uses encrypted socket communication to hide stolen data. Disguised as various apps, it is widely distributed across alternative platforms.\n\n“In the first stage, the app’s main activity, defined in AndroidManifest.xml, decrypts an XOR-encrypted file and loads it dynamically. This initial file acts as a loader for the next stage. In the second stage, the dynamically loaded file decrypts another AES-encrypted file and loads it. This second stage still does not reveal the core malicious behavior but serves as another layer of obfuscation. Finally, in the third stage, the decrypted file contains code related to the .NET MAUI framework, which is then loaded to execute the main payload.” continues the report. “ The main payload is ultimately hidden within the C# code. When the user interacts with the app, such as pressing a button, the malware silently steals their data and sends it to the C2 server.”\n\nCybercriminals are increasingly using .NET MAUI-based malware to evade detection through techniques like hidden code blobs, multi-stage loading, encryption, and obfuscation. The researchers pointed out that these threats can remain undetected for long periods, and their growing prevalence suggests they are becoming more common. Users should avoid unofficial app sources, use security software, and stay updated to protect against evolving cyber threats.\n\nThe report includes Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for these threats.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, Android malware)"

    "content": "Chinese APT Weaver Ant infiltrated a telco in Asia for over four years\n\nPierluigi Paganini March 24, 2025 March 24, 2025\n\nChina-linked APT Weaver Ant infiltrated the network of a telecommunications services provider for over four years.\n\nThe China-linked threat actor Weaver Ant infiltrated the network of a telecom provider in Asia for over four years.\n\nDuring a forensic investigation, Sygnia researchers observed multiple alerts that revealed a re-enabled threat actor account by a service account from an unidentified server. Further analysis uncovered a China Chopper web shell on an internal server, compromised for years. This led to the discovery of Weaver Ant’s activity, a China-linked group using web shells for persistence, remote code execution, and lateral movement through tunneling.\n\nThe experts detected multiple web shells, including a previously unknown one dubbed “INMemory”. The China Chopper web shell, originally developed by Chinese threat actors, enables remote access and control over compromised web servers, facilitating persistent access, command execution, and data exfiltration.\n\nThe encrypted China Chopper variant, frequently used by the attackers, employed AES encryption to evade detection by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). It was deployed on externally facing servers using ASPX and PHP, serving as an entry point for network infiltration. This encryption allowed the attackers to bypass automated detection mechanisms, making forensic analysis challenging.\n\nTwo key evasion techniques hindered the investigation. First, attackers used specific keywords, such as “password” and “key,” in the payload, which WAFs typically redact in logs, obscuring the malicious content. Second, the transmitted payload often exceeded the character limits of logging mechanisms, resulting in truncated data that made full forensic reconstruction difficult. These strategies ensured stealthy, persistent access to compromised systems.\n\nThe INMemory web shell allows attackers to execute malicious modules in memory, avoiding disk-based detection. It decodes a hardcoded GZipped Base64 string into a PE file, ‘eval.dll,’ and executes it dynamically. The web shell obfuscates code using Base64-encoded strings and validates HTTP request headers via SHA256 hash comparison. If a match is found, it encodes the payload in Base64 and UTF-8 before executing it using ‘JScriptEvaluate,’ leveraging the JScript library for dynamic execution. This technique enhances stealth by preventing forensic analysis and signature-based detection, allowing attackers to persist undetected in compromised environments.\n\nOne notable tool was a recursive HTTP tunnel, enabling web shell tunneling for lateral movement. This method leveraged compromised web servers as proxies to relay HTTP/S traffic, accessing internal resources without deploying additional tools. By dynamically constructing and executing cURL commands, the tunneling mechanism allowed the attacker to navigate segmented networks stealthily. Since communication occurred over expected web traffic, it blended in with legitimate activity, making detection difficult while facilitating command and control across compromised environments.\n\nWeaver Ant deployed multiple payloads to evade detection, maintain persistence, and expand access within compromised networks. They patched the Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) to suppress event logs and bypassed the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) by modifying ‘amsi.dll’, allowing malicious PowerShell execution. They also ran PowerShell commands via ‘System.Management.Automation.dll’ without using PowerShell.exe, avoiding detection. For lateral movement, they leveraged SMB with NTLM hashes, deploying additional web shells and extracting credentials from IIS configuration files.\n\n“As part of its reconnaissance efforts, Weaver Ant executed various ‘Invoke-SharpView’ commands against multiple Domain Controllers within the same Active Directory (AD) Forest. These commands included: ‘Get-DomainUserEvent’, ‘Get-DomainSubnet’, ‘Get-DomainUser’, ‘Get-NetSession’ etc.” reads the report published by Sygnia. “The primary objective was to enumerate the compromised Active Directory environment to identify high-privilege accounts and critical servers and add them to their target bank. “\n\nThe researchers believe Weaver Ant is a nation-state actor specializing in long-term network access for cyber espionage. The group focuses on network intelligence, credential harvesting, and persistent access to telecom infrastructure, its operations align with state-sponsored espionage objectives.\n\nSygnia attributes its activities to China based on the use of Zyxel routers operated by Southeast Asian telecommunication providers, backdoors linked to Chinese groups, and operations during GMT +8 business hours.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, China)"

Elastic researchers found dozens of samples from August 2024 to February 2025, likely signed with stolen certificates.\n\n“All samples are signed using likely stolen, revoked certificates from Chinese companies. These certificates are widely known and shared across different malware samples and campaigns but are not specific to this driver.” reads the report published by Elastic.\n\nABYSSWORKER employs functions with constant return values, using opaque predicates and derivation functions to obstruct static analysis. The experts pointed out that only three such functions exist and are not used in predicates, the obfuscation is ineffective and easily identifiable.\n\nUpon initialization, the driver loads kernel module pointers and sets up a client protection feature. It then creates a device and symbolic link before registering callbacks for its major functions.\n\nWhen the driver device is opened, it adds the process ID to a protection list and removes existing handles to the target process. It retrieves the client’s process ID from the kernel thread and strips access rights from other processes using brute-force PID iteration. The driver then registers callbacks to prevent unauthorized handle creation, ensuring protected processes remain inaccessible.\n\nThe ABYSSWORKER driver processes device I/O control requests by dispatching them to handlers based on the control code. These handlers enable file manipulation, process termination, and driver removal, allowing the malware to disable EDR systems effectively.\n\n“To copy or delete files, ABYSSWORKER relies on a strategy that, although not new, remains interesting. Instead of using a common API like NtCreateFile , an I/O Request Packet (IRP) is created from scratch and sent directly to the corresponding drive device containing the target file.” continues the report.\n\nElastic created a client implementation example that allows loading the driver’s APIs, it also created the YARA rules to detect the threat.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)"
