        "raw_content": "Eskenzi PR, organisers of The Most Inspiring Women in Cyber Awards, are proud to announce the theme of this year’s event panel discussion: Keeping DEI on the agenda: progressing, not regressing. The panel topic, informed by ideas submitted by nominators, will be discussed at the event to be held at The BT Tower, London, on Wednesday 26th February 2025. This year’s event is sponsored by KnowBe4, BT, Bridewell, Mimecast, Varonis, Pentest-Tools and AI Dionic. In 2025, aided by a turbulent global political climate, DEI initiatives are under threat from falling off the agenda. This could prove very regressive for under-represented talent, especially in industries like cybersecurity, where diversity is already a significant issue. So, how can we keep the conversation going forward without necessarily having the policy in place to back it? And how can we make sure organisations don’t regress in their attitudes to diverse hiring? These are the questions the industry leading panellists will be discussing. In 2025, The Most Inspiring Women in Cyber Awards expanded its partnerships with industry leading community groups, including WiCyS UK&I Affiliate, CyBlack, WiTCH and InClusive InCyber. Representatives from each of these groups will sit on the panel. Each of these groups bring the unique experiences of their thousands of members to the panel, reflecting the state of the industry from those who experience it first hand. This year’s panel will be moderated by Yvonne Eskenzi, Co-Founder of Eskenzi PR, the cybersecurity PR agency, and will include speakers, such as: Dr.Iretioluwa Akerele, Founder of CyBlack (and 2024 winner) Aymun Lashari, Community Manager at LT Harper, who run the popular InClusive InCyber initiative Illyana Muillins, Founder of WiTCH (2022 ‘One to Watch’ and 2024 winner) Danu Sivapalan, Senior Product Manager, Identity & Access Management, at Sainsbury’s, and Head of Partnerships at WiCyS UK&I Affiliate Dr. Runli Guo, Founder and CEO of AI Dionic, who are sp"

        "raw_content": "GitGuardian Sponsored March 19, 2025 Share Report: The State of Secrets Sprawl 2025 GitGuardian’s State of Secrets Sprawl 2025 report shows no progress in combating secrets sprawl, with 23.8 million secrets leaked on public GitHub repositories in 2024—a 25% year-over-year increase. Despite GitHub Push Protection’s efforts, secrets sprawl is accelerating, especially with generic secrets, which made up 58% of all leaked credentials. More troubling, 70% of secrets leaked in 2022 remain active, significantly expanding the attack surface for threat actors. The report makes one thing clear: secrets management must evolve beyond detection. Organizations must proactively prevent, discover, detect, and remediate leaked credentials before exploitation. GitGuardian recommends a multi-layered approach to secrets security: Deploy real-time monitoring for leaked credentials across all environments. Implement centralized secrets detection to track exposure across repositories, collaboration tools, and containers. Enforce semi-automated secrets rotation policies to eliminate long-lived credentials. Provide clear guidelines for developers on secure vault usage and secrets hygiene.

PHOTO: Cybercrime Magazine. 23 Feb Cybersecurity Jobs Report: 3.5 Million Unfilled Positions In 2025 Posted at 03:01h in Reports by Cybercrime Magazine While tech firms are firing, our industry is hiring Download Report – Steve Morgan, Editor-in-Chief Sausalito, Calif. – Apr. 14, 2023 Global cybersecurity job vacancies grew by 350 percent, from one million openings in 2013 to 3.5 million in 2021, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. The number of unfilled jobs leveled off in 2022, and remains at 3.5 million in 2023, with more than 750,000 of those positions in the U.S. Industry efforts to source new talent and tackle burnout continues, but we predict that the disparity between demand and supply will remain through at least 2025. Press Release Technology firms have shed more than 300,000 jobs in the past two years with more on the way, according to a recent FOX Business story. Redundancy tracker Layoffs.fyi, which has been tracking layoffs since the pandemic, reports 470 tech employers have reduced their workforces. Cybercrime Radio: Help Wanted, Young People Cybersecurity is the land of opportunity “While Amazon, Meta, Twitter, Microsoft, Google, and the other tech giants are going through layoffs, our industry has hung out an enormous Help Wanted sign,” Steve Morgan, founder of Cybersecurity Ventures, told FOX Business. “We expect brisk hiring in the cybersecurity space for the rest of this year, and through 2025.” Despite the disarray of the tech industry, cybersecurity remains a near-zero unemployment marketplace for those with extensive backgrounds, and the shortage means that IT teams must also shoulder a security burden. Staff must train in modern threat awareness, including phishing, social engineering, Business Email Compromise (BEC), and financial fraud. They must also know how to protect and defend apps, data, devices, infrastructure, and people. Every IT position is also a cybersecurity position now. Every IT worker, every technology w"

While most privacy policies are based on templates, we have decided to simplify things and explicitly identify all aspects of our work that might impact your privacy. Visitor analytics In Q4 2020 we switched from Google Analytics to Matomo Cloud, so that Help Net Security may become a cookie-free web site. If you check our analytics code, you will see the instruction: _paq.push([‘disableCookies’]); We have enabled all the privacy options the Matomo solution provides: We anonymize the last 2 bytes of our visitors’ IP address(es) (e.g. 192.168.2.1 is seen as 192.168.0.0) We replace the user ID with a pseudonym to avoid storing and displaying personally identifiable information (Matomo creates the pseudonym by salting and hashing the user ID) We regularly delete old data – all raw data older than 186 days is automatically deleted No tracking cookies Help Net Security is a web site that doesn’t serve any tracking cookies. In Q4 2020 we replaced all the cookie-serving services we previously used with privacy-preserving solutions. Matomo is our analytics tool of choice, and we switched from SoundCloud to an internal solution, which offers cookie-free embedded podcast code.

The rise in cyber threats is pushing organizations to invest more in their defenses. AI tools are making these threats more sophisticated, which is adding to the urgency. IDC says this steady climb in spending will continue through 2028, hitting $377 billion by then. The U.S. and Western Europe will still make up more than 70% of global security spending in 2025. But other regions are catching up. Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and the Middle East and Africa are expected to see the fastest growth this year. “Growing digital transformation and hiking emerging technology adoption across the Middle East & Africa (MEA) region — especially countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) — have pushed the demand significantly for security solutions to face the evolving threat landscapes. MEA is witnessing substantial investments from both government and enterprises to fight rising cyber threats, with strong awareness for the importance of cybersecurity education and training programs to fortify organizations against possible attacks,” says Eman Elshewy, senior research manager with IDC Data and Analytics. Security software will be the largest technology group in 2025, representing more than half of the worldwide security market this year, as well as the fastest growing one, with a 14.4% year-on-year growth rate. The security software market growth will be driven especially by cloud native application protection platform (CNAPP), identity and access management software, and security analytics software growth, reflecting the special focus that companies will put on integrated cyberthreats detection and response around their whole organizational perimeter. Security services will be the second fastest-growing technology group in 20"

        "raw_content": "Mirko Zorz, Director of Content, Help Net Security March 27, 2025 Share The hidden costs of security tool bloat and how to fix it In this Help Net Security interview, Shane Buckley, President and CEO at Gigamon, discusses why combating tool bloat is a top priority for CISOs as they face tighter budgets and expanding security stacks. Buckley shares insights on how deep observability can streamline security operations, optimize costs, and strengthen a defense-in-depth strategy. Many CISOs are under pressure to reduce security budgets while maintaining strong defenses. Why should combating tool bloat be a top priority this year? CISOs constantly face the challenge of doing more with less. They are tasked with implementing a defense-in-depth strategy—a layered cybersecurity approach that protects against both front-end and back-end threats. This task grows increasingly complex as organizations adopt hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures, integrate AI, expand security tool stacks, and navigate escalating management challenges. One of the biggest challenges CISOs face is tool bloat or the accumulation of redundant or underutilized security tools that can drive up costs, create inefficiencies, and complicate integration. In 2024, tool bloat ranked among the top five CISO concerns. While layering security tools aims to strengthen defenses, it can lead to fragmentation, silos, and blind spots that can weaken overall security. This fragmentation can ultimately compromise a defense-in-depth strategy, increasing the risk of breaches. To address this, organizations must prioritize gaining complete visibility into all data in motion, monitoring East-West (lateral) movement and improving the fidelity of telemetry through network-based metadata. Deep observability, the integration of log and network telemetry data, not only streamlines security tool stacks and enhances efficiency but also reduces complexity—ensuring every tool delivers a meaningful contribution to a defense-in-dep"

        "raw_content": "Mirko Zorz, Director of Content, Help Net Security March 27, 2025 Share Cyber insurance isn’t always what it seems Many companies think cyber insurance will protect them from financial losses after an attack. But many policies have gaps. Some claims get denied. Others cover less than expected. CISOs must understand the risks before an attack happens. Misconceptions about cyber insurance Myth: Insurance will cover all costs after a breach. Reality: Policies often exclude key expenses. Some won’t cover ransomware payments. Others limit payouts for business downtime. Myth: If we meet security standards, our claim will be paid. Reality: Insurers review security at the time of the attack. If they find weak spots, they might deny a claim. Myth: Nation-state attacks are covered. Reality: Many policies call them “acts of war.” That means no payout. Matthew Rosenquist, CISO at Mercury Risk and Compliance, cautions that while cyber insurance is a helpful tool, it’s often misunderstood. Too many organizations “make the mistake of believing insurance can be an effective replacement or the centerpiece of a comprehensive cybersecurity risk management strategy,” he said. In reality, insurance doesn’t stop breaches or ransomware. It merely displaces some of the financial losses for extreme cyberattacks. “Insurance is a mechanism to transfer risk, not mitigate it,” Rosenquist explained. It doesn’t lower the chances of an incident, but it can soften the financial blow if one occurs. With cyberattack costs sometimes reaching into the millions or even billions, he noted, having a policy in place can offer “a valuable piece of mind.” Still, insurance is no silver bullet. Policies often come with limitations, high premiums, and strict requirements around security posture. “Insurers scrutinize security postures, enforce stringent requirements, and may deny claims if proper controls are not in place,” he said. Many policies also include exclusions and coverage gaps that add complexity to t"

For organizations, cybersecurity can’t be treated as separate from world events anymore, they’re closely connected. Conflict between countries is spilling into cyberspace. Whether it’s during military escalations, trade disputes, or diplomatic standoffs, governments are using cyber operations to exert pressure, gather intelligence, or disrupt systems. These attacks often hit private businesses, not just governments or critical infrastructure. One growing concern is the blurred line between cybercrime and state-sponsored hacking. Criminal groups sometimes work directly with governments, or at least operate with their blessing. This makes attribution harder and retaliation riskier. A PwC report outlines how board members and CEOs are paying closer attention. Executives are asking new questions about risk exposure. For example, does the company rely on suppliers in politically unstable regions? Are there assets located in jurisdictions with rising tensions? These are now cybersecurity questions, not just supply chain ones. Industrial cyber threats are growing more strategic Energy, manufacturing, and healthcare remain top targets. But the range of sectors at risk is expanding. According to Dragos’ 2025 OT/ICS Cybersecurity report, cyber threats to operational technology (OT) are becoming more strategic. Adversaries are learning the inner workings of industrial environments and probing for weak spots. This is not limited to power grids or water plants. Any system that blends physical and digital components is vulnerable. In a geopolitical crisis, these systems can become high-value targets for sabotage or disruption.

Attackers are moving quicker, disruptions happen all the time, and many security plans built for more predictable times just can’t keep up. With everything from ransomware to geopolitical threats to cloud slip-ups hitting companies, there’s a shift happening: security needs to be ready for chaos, not just focused on keeping things safe.\nThat shift changes everything: how companies plan, how they invest, and how they recover.\nFrom protection to resilience\nCybersecurity used to focus primarily on prevention. But in today’s environment, that’s not enough. That’s where cyber resilience comes in. Instead of just keeping attackers out, it focuses on keeping the business running during and after an attack. It combines security, crisis response, and recovery. It assumes something will go wrong and builds systems to adapt, bounce back quickly, and learn from the damage.\nThe best strategies treat resilience as a\ncore part of business operations\n, not just a security add-on.\n“The key to managing resilience is to approach it like an onion,” says\nJames Morris\n, Chief Executive of The CSBR. “The best strategy is to be effective at managing the perimeter. This approach will allow you to get a level of control on internal and external forces which are key to long-term resilience.”\nThat layered thinking should be matched by clearly defined policies and procedures. “Ensure that your ‘resilience’ strategy and policies are documented in detail,” Morris advises. “This is critical for response planning, but also for any legal issues that may arise. If it’s not documented, it doesn’t happen.”\nDocumentation, however, is only part of the equation.

ShieldConex Orchestration offers a secure, data exchange solution that seamlessly integrates both multi-channel, vaultless tokenization with PCI-validated P2PE, reducing PCI compliance scope and enhancing data security without vendor lock-in.\n“Managing sensitive cardholder data across processors, acquirers, and platforms has become increasingly complex, particularly for merchants operating in omnichannel environments,” said\nTim Barnett\n, Chief Information Officer at Bluefin. “With the addition of network tokenization to ShieldConex, our clients can offload that complexity. They gain direct access to the security, efficiency, and cost benefits of network tokens, without the overhead of managing it themselves.”\nWith this launch, Bluefin simplifies network tokenization access and management for merchants who would otherwise need to interface directly with each network.\n“ShieldConex now stands as one of the industry’s most comprehensive platforms for sensitive data security – combining vendor-agnostic vaultless tokenization, network tokenizat"

With cybercrime costs expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, marking a 15% year-over-year increase, organizations urgently need a solution that surpasses traditional security methods.\nOver the past two years, 77,000 organizations have rapidly adopted AI coding assistants, despite research showing that AI-assisted coding tools like GitHub Copilot introduce ~29% more security vulnerabilities. Additionally, developers are increasingly “vibe coding” with LLMs increasingly without conducting thorough reviews of their changes.\nConcurrently, cybercriminals have adopted sophisticated AI-driven techniques, including prompt injection attacks and malicious code embedded in AI models and software packages, exacerbating the threat landscape.\nFurthermore, security teams are increasingly understaffed to conduct manual code reviews, with the current ratio often at 1 security engineer per 200 developers, far from the ideal. This disparity, coupled with the high false-positive rates of traditional SAST tools (exceeding 20%), has significantly hindered effective vulnerability management.\nCorgea is making its BLAST scanner publicly available to address these challenges through:\nAI-driven vulnerability detection:\nBLAST leverages advanced AI and contextual analysis to uncover vulnerabilities traditional scanners and human reviewers miss, while significantly reducing false positives and alert fatigue.\nAutomated code remediation:\nAut"

The truth about third-party access In this Help Net Security video, Fran Rosch, CEO at Imprivata, discusses organizations’ challenges in securing third-party access and offers valuable insights on how businesses can address these risks effectively. A recent report conducted by the Ponemon Institute, “The State of Third-Party Access in Cybersecurity,” found that third-party data breaches have severe consequences across critical sectors, with data theft and loss posing the greatest risk. Healthcare is the most affected, with 60% of breaches leading to stolen or lost sensitive information, followed closely by finance at 56% and industrial sectors at 48%. Beyond the immediate exposure of sensitive data, these breaches also carry regulatory and legal repercussions. The healthcare and financial industries face the highest regulatory fines, at 49% and 45%, respectively. All sectors contend with legal challenges, with financial and industrial organizations both reporting a 41% impact. The fallout from these breaches extends beyond compliance concerns, affecting business relationships and revenue. In healthcare, 47% of organizations sever ties with third-party vendors following a breach, a trend mirrored in the financial (43%) and industrial (43%) sectors, underscoring how interconnected these industries are with external partners. Financial losses are also a significant consequence, with the industrial sector experiencing the highest percentage of revenue loss at 45%, followed closely by healthcare at 42%, and finance at 34%. These figures highlight how vulnerabilities in one organization can create cascading effects, making third-party cybersecurity a priority.

They need to put in place: 1. A seamless AI security policy AI may have previously been a technology that only developers or specialists interacted with, but today, at all levels within companies, employees use AI to assist them in various tasks. Organizations must therefore educate all employees on which LLMs and agent applications they are authorized to use and the type of data they are allowed to share with these systems. A well-defined policy is essential for companies to deploy and leverage this technology securely. This technology will continue to move fast and innovate giving automation and machines more power in organizational decision-making, and the first line of defense for companies is a clear, accessible AI policy that the whole company is aware of and subscribes to. Enforcing a security policy also means defining what risk ratings are acceptable for an organization, and the ability to reprioritize the risk ratings as the environment changes. There are always going to be errors and false positives. Different organizations have different risk tolerances or different interpretations depending on their operations and data sensitivity. It is important that organizations remember that the goal of a security policy is to not interrupt employee workflows or make it hard to follow but ultimately to protect the organization and its customers. The more seamless the security policies are, the less likely those within a company will try to bypass them to leverage AI innovation. 2. Make sure developers have secure code knowledge In addition to rolling out clear security policies around the use of AI, companies must also consider their developers’ desire to use new "

It brought about increased convenience and efficiency, but has also opened new doors for cybercriminals, particularly on the Android platform, which dominates the global smartphone market. According to ESET research, Android financial threats, targeting banking apps and cryptocurrency wallets, grew by 20% in H2 of 2024 compared to the first half of the year. Fortunately, large financial institutions like banks have significant resources, enabling them to invest in and implement comprehensive cybersecurity measures to protect their systems and customers. However, smaller banks, wealth management firms or insurance agencies are often more vulnerable to cyberattacks. That’s because, while adopting secure technology practices and promoting cyber awareness among their teams is essential for them and their customers, many mid-size and small businesses struggle to implement such measures, leaving them exposed to potential threats. Why target small business’ finances? Small businesses, often limited in resources and expertise, are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated financial cyberattacks. Businesses like accounting and payroll services that manage client payments or process sensitive transactions are particularly at risk, as a single breach can cost customer trust and have long-lasting reputational and financial repercussions. Understanding the emerging threats and implementing proactive measures to protect both customers and business operations has become more critical than ever. Alarming trends Research has revealed an alarming trend around Android-targeted financial threats. Attackers are leveraging Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and Web Android Package Kits (WebAPKs) to create malicious applications that can bypass traditional"

It’s typically delivered through dull online videos or uninspiring exercises that fail to capture real-world urgency. To make a real difference in cyber crisis readiness, personnel need the opportunity to test their mettle in a crisis, to build the muscle memory and decision-making skills that will make a difference when a real attack occurs. This is where cyber simulations come in, by providing the opportunity to assess knowledge recall and judgment under the pressures of a genuine crisis. But building an effective cyber simulation is not a simple process. Incorrect implementation can result in simulations becoming another tick box exercise, or could even have an adverse impact, with staff feeling they wasted their time on an exercise where they didn’t learn or accomplish anything. So, what should organizations actively do to make these simulations as real and valuable as possible? Step 1: Define the objective To be valuable and avoid becoming just another compliance exercise, skills development needs a clear purpose. Deciding the focus and delivering the program will typically be the responsibility of the CISO as the most senior security leader, or the head of resilience. However, there should be a strong collaborative aspect, with input from security, disaster recovery, and other involved teams. To make a real difference, there must be a threat-led approach. Identify the most relevant threats to your company based on its unique structure, industry, and regulatory landscape. It’s important to have a clear idea of the specific skills and processes you want to validate. This could be technical capabilities, executive decision-making, cross-team coordination, or a combination of factors. Simulations must challenge actual weaknesses and stress points, not just reinforce stre"

It promises to eliminate secrets in logs, reduce risks in CI/CD pipelines, and save countless hours chasing security anomalies.\nBut there’s one final boss to clear: the C-suite. Convincing leadership, especially those more attuned to balance sheets than breach reports, can feel like selling a Wi-Fi router to someone without any internet connection. Securing buy-in is not just a technical challenge. It’s a game of strategy, storytelling, and persuasion. Here’s how to win them over.\n1. Lead with business value, not features\nExecutives care about outcomes, such as cost savings, operational efficiency, and competitive edge. Therefore, you can start by framing the tool as a business enabler, not a technical upgrade.\nFor instance, ensuring business continuity through advanced threat detection isn’t just a technical win—it directly boosts revenue. Every minute of downtime costs an organization thousands, if not millions, in lost sales and damaged customer trust. A cybersecurity tool that proactively identifies vulnerabilities safeguards revenue streams and ensures uninterrupted operations.\n2. Paint a clear picture of what’s at stake\nThe risks of inaction are mounting in light of new regulations such as the EU’s\nCyber Resilience Act\n, and the consequences can be devastating. Data is your ultimate sidekick in highlighting security breaches’ financial, operational, and reputational costs.\nFor smaller organizations, a breach can be existential, eroding trust and crippling operations overnight. You can shift the narrative toward resilience and stability by framing cybersecurity investments as essential safeguards rather than optional expenses. After all, it’s unlikely tha"

To effectively manage and mitigate the cyber-risks hiding in modern attack surfaces, it’s important to adopt an attacker-centric approach. In this article, we will be diving deeper into a company’s attack surface, what might have been forgotten and overlooked during the day-to-day rush and how cybersecurity professionals can regain the momentum and overview with the help of external attack surface management tools. What makes up your organizations attack surface? Security specialists generally define the attack surface as the sum of all possible points in a system or network where attacks can be launched against. In other words, it can be described as the sum of all potential attack vectors. On the other hand, those responsible for security in companies need a concept that helps them to defend their networks. We recommend an approach that starts with the attacker (known attack methods, known or exploited vulnerabilities, etc.) and prioritizes the threats with the highest risk to the company. To make the determination easier and more systematic, you can also divide the elements of your attack surface into suitable categories. A useful initial subdivision of relevant points of attack – from the perspective of attackers – would be as follows: Online accessible points of attack (e.g. weak or compromised passwords, vulnerabilities in software or communication protocols, configuration errors, exploitable servers) Points of attack for social engineering (employees with special privileges, permissions or information) Starting points for supply chain attacks (e.g. update processes) Points of attack that require physical access to hardware (e.g. USB sticks with keyloggers and malware, penetration into unse"

        "raw_content": "Mirko Zorz, Director of Content, Help Net Security April 1, 2025 Share Generative AI is reshaping financial fraud. Can security keep up? In this Help Net Security interview, Yinglian Xie, CEO at DataVisor, explains how evolving fraud tactics require adaptive, AI-driven prevention strategies. With fraudsters using generative AI to launch sophisticated attacks, financial institutions must adopt adaptive AI solutions to stay ahead. Xie points out the role of real-time data orchestration, machine learning, and integrated security platforms in balancing fraud prevention with a seamless user experience. How are fraud tactics evolving with the rise of generative AI and automated attack tools? Fighting financial fraud has always been an arms race between financial institutions and fraudsters, and AI has made it a much tighter race. As payments innovations continue, legacy fraud solutions can’t keep pace. Today, you need to be able to fight AI with AI to beat fraudsters at their own game. With many fraudsters leveraging generative AI to launch attacks, fraud solutions can leverage generative AI to stay ahead in many areas. For example, generative AI has already been adopted to automate rule creation and tuning to provide better detection and save fraud teams time and money on trial-and-error methods. Organizations need to have adaptive responses to be ready for new and evolving fraud and scam attacks. Sophisticated AI technologies and machine learning models can analyze large sets of data and signals in real-time to identify hidden patterns and correlations through usage patterns, device information, location information, network characteristics. These technologies are essential in identifying new and evolving threats, and they continuously improve over time, which is particularly crucial in combating deepfake threats. Many organizations struggle with balancing fraud prevention and user experience. How should they navigate that tradeoff? Balancing fraud protection and user f"

To stay competitive, financial institutions must strike a balance between regulatory compliance, automation, and strategic innovation—ensuring that risk models are not just resilient but agile enough to drive smarter, faster decisions in an increasingly complex landscape. A recent FT Longitude survey “Transforming Risk Management” revealed that while 67% of banks plan to modernize their risk modeling capabilities within the next two years, the path forward is not without challenges. Regulatory demands now dictate risk management strategies for 56% of banks—up from 46% in 2021—while automation is viewed as both a necessity and a strategic differentiator. This webinar will explore: The evolving role of automation: How banks are balancing efficiency with regulatory demands in risk modeling The use of AI and machine learning in risk decisioning: laying baer new opportunities and challenges in model validation and governance Retail banking trends: Why 70% of retail banks are prioritizing automation in risk measurement and management Strategic investment priorities: How financial institutions are approaching low-code/no-code solutions and AI-driven decisioning Competitive advantage in risk transformation: Why 63% of banks see it as a key differentiator Building on the themes of agility and adaptive risk management discussed in our first session, this second webinar delves deeper into how financial institutions are leveraging technology, automation, and AI to transform risk modeling."

Other investors include Microsoft, Coatue, Altimeter Capital and Thrive Capital. The valuation places OpenAI alongside TikTok parent ByteDance and just behind SpaceX in global private company rankings. A substantial portion of the new capital will fund OpenAI's infrastructure projects, including the SoftBank-Oracle joint venture Stargate initiative, CNBC reported, citing an unnamed source. An initial $10 billion is expected to be deployed earlier this year, with the remaining $30 billion expected by the end of 2025. SoftBank's commitment could be reduced to $20 billion if OpenAI does not transition to a for-profit structure by year-end. Such a shift would require approval from Microsoft and California regulators and potentially face intensified legal challenges from OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk. OpenAI's current governance model consists of a capped-profit limited partnership controlled by a nonprofit entity. If the restructuring proceeds, the nonprofit would spin out as an independent body and investors holding convertible notes would receive equity stakes (see: Safety Concerns, Pushback Against OpenAI's For-Profit Plan). The funding comes amid rapid growth for OpenAI. ChatGPT now has 500 million weekly users, up from 400 million last month. Its revenue is projected to triple to $12.7 billion by year-end, while the broader AI market is expected"

The flaw is an out-of-bounds vulnerability in Enhanced Metafile Recode processing, which could allow remote code execution, posing significant security risks to organizations relying on these devices. An out-of-bounds vulnerability in Enhanced Metafile Recode processing occurs when the software improperly handles memory during image data conversion. This flaw can lead to memory corruption, allowing attackers to overwrite adjacent memory locations. If exploited, it could enable remote code execution, granting unauthorized control over the affected system. Attackers can craft malicious EMF files that trigger the flaw when processed, potentially leading to system crashes, data leaks, or full device compromise, especially in networked environments. Microsoft Offensive Research and Security Engineering Team reported the flaw, which received a CVSS severity rating of 9.4. An attacker could remotely execute code. Mahmoud Rabie, principal solutions consultant at Cyberani by Aramco Digital in a LinkedIn post said that the issue impacts network security, business continuity and compliance. \"Compromised printers can serve as entry points for broader network attacks, putting o"

Organizations use secret management tools like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, and Azure Key Vault to protect sensitive access credentials. As businesses expand, particularly through mergers and acquisitions (M&A), they very often inherit multiple overlapping secret managers, creating hidden security and operational risks. .tdi_13.tdi_13.td-a-rec:not(.td-a-rec-no-translate).tdi_13 .tdi_13.tdi_13.td-a-rec-img img.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_all img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_tl img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_tp img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_mob img@media (max-width:767px) var td_screen_width = window.innerWidth; window.addEventListener(\"load\", function(){ var placeAdEl = document.getElementById(\"td-ad-placeholder\"); if ( null !== placeAdEl && td_screen_width >= 1140 ) { /* large monitors */ var adEl = document.createElement(\"ins\"); placeAdEl.replaceWith(adEl); adEl.setAttribute(\"class\", \"adsbygoogle\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"style\", \"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"data-ad-client\", \"ca-pub-6775182312059262\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"data-ad-slot\", \"1109178401\"); (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push(); } });window.addEventListener(\"load\", function(){ var placeAdEl = document.getElementById(\"td-ad-placeholder\"); if ( null !== placeAdEl && td_screen_width >= 1019 && td_screen_width < 1140 ) { /* landscape tablets */ var adEl = document.createElement(\"ins\"); placeAdEl.replaceWith(adEl); adEl.setAttribute(\"class\", \"adsbygoogle\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"style\", \"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250"

        "raw_content": "News Google Calendar leading to Phishing Scams and Data Thefts By Naveen Goud - [ Join Cybersecurity Insiders ] 148 Google Calendar is a widely used tool for scheduling online events, meetings, and sending reminders. However, a concerning new trend has emerged where cybercriminals are exploiting this platform to target unsuspecting victims with phishing scams and attempts to steal sensitive data. In this type of attack, the hacker sends out a seemingly harmless invitation to an event, meeting, or even a payment reminder. Since these invitations often come from familiar sources, like a colleague, friend, or even a business partner, recipients are more likely to trust the message and click on the embedded link. Unfortunately, this link leads to a fake website that closely mimics legitimate ones, tricking the victim into entering their sensitive information—such as usernames, passwords, and other credentials. .tdi_13.tdi_13.td-a-rec:not(.td-a-rec-no-translate).tdi_13 .tdi_13.tdi_13.td-a-rec-img img.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_all img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_tl img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_tp img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_mob img@media (max-width:767px) var td_screen_width = window.innerWidth; window.addEventListener(\"load\", function(){ var placeAdEl = document.getElementById(\"td-ad-placeholder\"); if ( null !== placeAdEl && td_screen_width >= 1140 ) { /* large monitors */ var adEl = document.createElement(\"ins\"); placeAdEl.replaceWith(adEl); adEl.setAttribute(\"class\", \"adsbygoogle\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"style\", \"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"data-ad-client\", \"ca-pub-6775182312059262\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"data-ad-slot\", \"1109178401\"); (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push(); } });window.addEventListener(\"load\", function(){ var placeAdEl = document.getElementById(\"td-ad-placeholder\"); if ( null !== placeAdEl && td_screen_width >= 1019 && td_screen_width < 1140 ) { /* landscape tablets */ var adEl = document.createElement(\"ins\"); placeAdEl.replaceW"

By Naveen Goud - [ Join Cybersecurity Insiders ] 85344 The Year 2017 has so far witnessed some data slip-ups from the worlds top cloud storage providers and the details are as follows- Accenture- World’s first Cyber Resilience startup UpGuard discovered in its Cyber Risk survey that Accenture left at least 4 AWS S3 storage buckets unsecured. And as a result of this flaw, the data on these storage media was available for download. The data exposed in this security goof-up were authentication credentials, secret API data, digital certificates, decryption keys, customer data, and other meta info which could be easily used by cyber crooks to mint money. It was revealed in the security analysis that more than 137GB of data was available for public access and some of the data might have been siphoned by hackers to post on the dark web. .tdi_13.tdi_13.td-a-rec:not(.td-a-rec-no-translate).tdi_13 .tdi_13.tdi_13.td-a-rec-img img.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_all img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_tl img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_tp img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_mob img@media (max-width:767px) var td_screen_width = window.innerWidth; window.addEventListener(\"load\", function(){ var placeAdEl = document.getElementById(\"td-ad-placeholder\"); if ( null !== placeAdEl && td_screen_width >= 1140 ) { /* large monitors */ var adEl = document.createElement(\"ins\"); placeAdEl.replaceWith(adEl); adEl.setAttribute(\"class\", \"adsbygoogle\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"style\", \"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"data-ad-client\", \"ca-pub-6775182312059262\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"data-ad-slot\", \"1109178401\"); (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push(); } });window.addEventListener(\"load\", function(){ var placeAdEl = document.getElementById(\"td-ad-placeholder\"); if ( null !== placeAdEl && td_screen_width >= 1019 && td_screen_width < 1140 ) { /* landscape tablets */ var adEl = document.createElement(\"ins\"); placeAdEl"

The move to autonomous AI Agents promises to be as big a leap forward as Generative AI was over traditional AI models. Whereas traditional AI assisted with analysis and recommendations, Agentic AI works by understanding the environment, making decisions, and taking action without human involvement. It is no surprise that Gartner lists Agentic AI as one of the top strategic trends in 2025 and anticipates it will resolve 80% of customer service issues by 2029. But with these massive advantages come new types of risks and threats. These risks go way beyond traditional AI problems like data poisoning and model poisoning due to the autonomy that AI agents possess. As Agentic AI can make decisions and interact with other AI agents in its own unique ecosystem, we are facing security challenges that conventional security has not encountered before.

Video streaming users forget their login details the most, with the top platform’s users requesting new passwords over four times a year. Content consumption platforms see up to 43 times more password reset requests than communication platforms. A recent study by Heepsy examines which social media platforms experience the highest number of password recovery attempts by analyzing search behavior. It includes 35 popular platforms, using their monthly active user counts to assess the scale of password issues. Data was collected from three common search queries: “[Platform] password reset,” “[Platform] forgot password,” and “[Platform] recover account.” These queries reflect users seeking help to regain access. Rankings based on searches per 100K users highlight where users struggle most with passwords, offering insights into potential usability or security issues. .tdi_13.tdi_13.td-a-rec:not(.td-a-rec-no-translate).tdi_13 .tdi_13.tdi_13.td-a-rec-img img.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_all img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_tl img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_tp img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_mob img@media (max-width:767px) var td_screen_width = window.innerWidth; window.addEventListener(\"load\", function(){ var placeAdEl = document.getElementById(\"td-ad-placeholder\"); if ( null !== placeAdEl && td_screen_width >= 1140 ) { /* large monitors */ var adEl = document.createElement(\"ins\"); placeAdEl.replaceWith(adEl); adEl.setAttribute(\"class\", \"adsbygoogle\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"style\", \"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"data-ad-client\", \"ca-pub-6775182312059262\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"data-ad-slot\", \"1109178401\"); ("

International agencies like CISA and NIST emphasize the urgent need to address how we inventory and manage the software and services we rely on. The complexity of modern software systems and the potential for widespread impact from a single compromised component drive this growing focus. Recent incidents, such as the SolarWinds, have shown how interconnected systems can be exploited. The global outage related to CrowdStrike’s software update shows how a single mistake can quickly cascade across the entire global economy. Regulatory bodies globally, including the European Union through the EU Cybersecurity Act, are actively working to mitigate the supply chain issues that enable these incidents. As security leaders, we can’t forget a critical part of the software supply chain: cryptography. Implementing comprehensive standards for cryptography usage, key management, and continuous monitoring can help effectively tackle these challenges. .tdi_13.tdi_13.td-a-rec:not(.td-a-rec-no-translate).tdi_13 .tdi_13.tdi_13.td-a-rec-img img.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_all img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_tl img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_tp img,.tdi_13 .td_spot_img_mob img@media (max-width:767px) var td_screen_width = window.innerWidth; window.addEventListener(\"load\", function(){ var placeAdEl = document.getElementById(\"td-ad-placeholder\"); if ( null !== placeAdEl && td_screen_width >= 1140 ) { /* large monitors */ var adEl = document.createElement(\"ins\"); placeAdEl.replaceWith(adEl); adEl.setAttribute(\"class\", \"adsbygoogle\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"style\", \"display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px\"); adEl.setAttribute(\"data-ad-client\", \""

        "raw_content": "When you hear “sensitive personal information,” what’s the first thing that comes to mind? Social security numbers? Addresses? Bank account information? It’s time to add a few more to the list: iris movement, facial recognition, fingerprints, voice identifiers and even your blood. Cyber attackers are targeting these deeply personal identifiers, taking privacy violations to a whole new level. Yet, while businesses struggle to secure biometric data, many consumers remain unaware of the growing risk.Consider this scenario: a company is gathering employees’ facial imagery, but because it’s not properly secured, hackers take the photo captures and use it to impersonate the CEO on a video call. They have enough data to know how the person moves, opens their mouth, and even their patterns of speech.Sound a bit far-fetched? Fraudsters have been recording manipulating images and video content sold on the black market as far back as 2019. Needless to say, businesses have a lot to lose, and a rising tide saves all boats. When organizations step up their efforts to secure biometric data, they reduce the opportunities for threat actors to exploit real faces, voices and fingerprints.The ripple effects of biometric breachesEvery day, we see the fallout when data is leaked. It’s all over the headlines and typically followed by a scramble to freeze credit accounts and change passwords. But what happens when a company fails to ethically gather and/or protect the information you can’t lock down?For the consumer, having your personal information stolen is devastating, especially when it’s information that you can’t change. Not only can it cause severe emotional distress, but it can also lead to identity fraud, blackmail or other criminal activities. But perhaps the worst part is that once your biometric data is out there, it’s out there for good. There’s little you can do to protect it in the first place, especially if organizations continue with the trend of failing to gather consent "

        "raw_content": "23andMe was a pioneer in the consumer genomics industry when it launched in 2006, the first company offering at-home DNA testing for ancestry and later adding a health information component. But after seeing its valuation fall from $6 billion USD in 2021 to only about $12 million in 2024, the company has recently entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That leaves consumers with very serious privacy concerns, as the idea of its collected data being sold off is floated, and many are scrambling to have it removed from the company’s database while it is still intact.The company has already been in business selling consumer data to pharmaceutical and biotech industries for some time, and the data it holds would remain protected under relevant laws pertaining to sensitive health information. However, the new recipients would not necessarily have to offer consumers the ability to opt out once they take possession of the data. And it remains unclear which (or how many) hands the data would wind up in, raising additional security as well as privacy concerns.Privacy concerns rampant among 23andMe’s 15 million customersAbout 15 million people who have submitted their DNA samples to the company over its nearly two decades in business are most directly impacted by these privacy concerns. Customers of the service have typically been opted in by default to “sharing” of data with third parties, which has contributed to prior sales to at least 30 other companies such as UK-based pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline; it is hard to say exactly how many and which companies have partnered with 23andMe in this way, as most of its agreements are kept confidential.Users have had to proactively opt out of these sales in their account settings, though the company retained the right to “share” data for 30 days after the request was initially made. Users can also request destruction of their genetic sample, something that happens automatically if they close their account and request that it be deleted."

        "raw_content": "The 2024 election season is facing an unprecedented challenge: AI-driven disinformation and cyberattacks. As AI’s influence grows, its ability to spread misinformation, create deepfakes, and target election systems becomes more dangerous. Just recently, the United States accused Russia of using generative AI in covert propaganda efforts, marking the first time AI has been publicly linked to foreign election interference. This incident highlights how bad actors can weaponize AI to undermine elections both domestically and abroad. It also underscores that the 2024 election season will be a true test of our resilience, not just in facing heightened risks but also in leveraging new tools to defend democracy.While AI has made it easier for bad actors to spread disinformation and execute cyberattacks, it has also empowered election officials and security experts with advanced technologies to counter these threats. As we continue to navigate through the blurred lines between fiction and reality, the challenge isn’t only about avoiding misinformation and cyberattacks, but also about harnessing AI to strengthen our defenses. Embracing proactive safeguards will be crucial in ensuring a fair and secure election.MisinformationA constant variable during the election season is misinformation. While this challenge has existed for years, AI has demonstrated the ability to amplify it. Just recently, a deepfake image of the superstar musician, Taylor Swift endorsing Donald Trump caused confusion online. Though debunked, this incident highlights how AI-generated content can mislead and confuse voters. In a similar incident, AI-generated robocalls were used in the New Hampshire primary election, mimicking the voice of Joe Biden, falsely informing voters that they should not vote in the primary and instead save their vote for the general election.Impersonation tactics are being used to impersonate election officials, creating emotionally charged content-which can be even more troubling "

        "raw_content": "Banks’ current measures against cyber fraud are falling short – and the numbers don’t lie. With a hyperactive threat landscape, what steps should financial institutions take to maximize cybersecurity?As the conduits of digital presence and payments diversify—due to an increasing number and variety of assets, perimeters, and interconnected systems—vulnerabilities are growing exponentially, putting pressure on financial institutions in Asia Pacific (APAC) to ensure robust security.Cybercriminals are becoming increasingly active in the APAC region. In fact, cybercriminal activities are predicted to cost victims approximately US$3.3 trillion by 2025. To effectively prevent fraud, the industry must adopt a more forward-thinking approach that focuses on monitoring and stopping fraudulent activity before it even begins. This requires moving away from siloed strategies and embracing a collective defense model that enhances collaboration and information sharing across stakeholders to combat fraud at a regional scale.However, this means cybersecurity teams today are also tasked with the immense challenge of reducing fraud in addition to their regular duties. Naturally, for teams that were originally established in large banks to handle transaction monitoring and flag compliance irregularities, leading a digital trust and safety agenda is a paradigm shift. Ensuring cybersecurity teams are adequately upskilled whilst leveraging cutting edge technology to build advanced and robust anti-fraud defenses is a delicate balancing act.Fraud prevention teams must devise proactive policies to protect brand integrity, user experience, and online transactions. But are they ready to cope with these additional requirements?Dealing with new fraud vectors proving to be a tall orderCybercriminals have increased their appetite and tactics for laundering money, crafting automated and manual attacks, maligning digital assets, and hijacking networks.Deepfakes bypassing Know Your Customer (KYC) chec"

        "raw_content": "Chances are, you’ve never had a meal without salt. Maybe salt was called for in the recipe. Maybe the chef added it in the kitchen. Maybe you added it yourself at the dinner table. Or maybe it’s in the ketchup, soy sauce, or any one of a hundred other condiments you might be using. Salt is literally everywhere. And yet, if someone asked you what you wanted for dinner, your answer probably wouldn’t be “salt.” Salt isn’t a centerpiece—it’s a secret agent. It works behind the scenes without drawing attention to itself, making everything it touches better and more flavorful. People don’t want to eat salt—they want to eat what’s been salted.Identity security needs to be like salt. It needs to play a background role that brings users joy by enabling them to do their jobs better…without ever drawing too much attention to itself. A good identity management solution is always there, always working, and always streamlining access without sacrificing security. In fact, examining the role salt plays in enhancing the culinary experience—from recipe to kitchen preparation to dining room table—can tell us a lot about the future of identity. There are significant parallels both in how identity functions and in the critical, behind-the-scenes way it makes the solutions around it work more effectively.Striking the Right BalanceFirst, let’s talk about measuring spoons and following recipes. We use measuring spoons when we need an exact, precise amount of an ingredient. If you’re baking a cake and it calls for a teaspoon of salt, you want to be pretty darn sure you don’t add any more than that. The right amount of salt can bring out all kinds of flavor…but too much salt can overwhelm the palate or render a sweet treat inedible. If you’re experimenting with a new recipe, getting the salt content right is important—and when you nail it, you write it down. You log it in your recipe book, and it enters your regular rotation, your family traditions. It becomes, essentially, a policy for how"

How Multi-Site Risk Assessments Can Guide Your Security Investments Portland Maine to Portland Oregon By Mark Landry, Contributing Writer Igor Kutyaev/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty Images October 30, 2024 When managing multiple sites across diverse regions—from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon—knowing where to allocate security resources can be a challenge. Multi-site risk assessments offer a data-driven approach to pinpoint vulnerabilities and prioritize investments, ensuring that your security measures are both effective and cost-efficient. With awareness of the challenges and an evaluation of both internal and external factors - these assessments can guide your security strategy, helping you invest in the right places at the right time. Data Challenges in Multi-Site Risk Assessment Navigating the complexities of multi-site risk assessments requires addressing a variety of data-related challenges. Risk is inherently subjective, with different stakeholders, whether site managers, executives, or local teams—perceiving threats differently based on their experiences or local conditions. This variability in perspective complicates the assessment process and necessitates a consistent approach to ensure balanced decision-making. One of the biggest hurdles is the inconsistency of local crime data. Reporting practices vary widely across regions, leading to incomplete or skewed datasets. Some areas may have detailed, accurate reports, while others underreport crime due to political or social pressures, creating discrepancies in crime statistics. These gaps in data make it difficult to form a comprehensive view of risk. Compounding these issues is the geographical diversity of sites. Each location presents unique risks, influ"

All for a manageable monthly fee. Learn more about AMAROK. Integrating Technology and Physical Security to Advance Duty of Care By Mark Landry, Contributing Writer Nattawit Khomsanit | Shutterstock.com December 23, 2024 In an era where workplace environments are constantly evolving, organizations face a profound responsibility to uphold their duty of care—ensuring the safety and well-being of their employees wherever they may be. This duty goes beyond providing a secure office space; it demands a comprehensive approach that integrates physical security measures with advanced technology to address risks in both digital and real-world settings. By embracing innovative tools and strategies, businesses can foster a culture of protection, adaptability, and trust that supports their employees in on-site, remote, and travel scenarios alike. Enhance Access Control SystemsModern access control solutions, such as biometric scanners, smart ID cards, and mobile app-based systems, bolster physical security by restricting unauthorized access to sensitive areas. These tools also provide real-time monitoring of who is entering and leaving a facility, enhancing accountability and situational awareness. They also allow for management across multiple sites – ideal for larger enterprises where user permissions may vary, and reports need to be seamless. Finally, in the case of employee termination, credentials can be updated immediately. Be keenly aware that older access control credentials/badges can be easily be cloned and hacked with off-the-shelf hardware. If your credentials aren’t properly encrypted, you may have gaping vulnerabilities to your access control plan. Surveillance and Monitoring TechnologiesAdvanced surveillance systems equipped with edge analytics offer more than just video recording.

With evolving threats, many institutions are reassessing their physical security measures, seeking solutions that protect students and staff without creating an environment that feels restrictive. One of the most significant advancements in school security is the integration of ballistic-resistant materials into facility design. From bulletproof glass at entry points to reinforced doors, these measures add an extra layer of protection while maintaining visibility and accessibility. However, implementing these upgrades requires strategic planning to align security, cost-effectiveness and compliance with regulations. The rise of ballistic-resistant materials in schools While traditional security measures such as surveillance cameras, access controls and security personnel remain critical, physical barriers offer an added layer of defense against external threats. Bullet-resistant glass for entry points and interior spaces Entry points are among the most vulnerable areas in a school, making bulletproof glass a highly effective upgrade. Unlike standard glass, bullet-resistant options are designed to absorb and disperse the energy of a ballistic impact, delaying or preventing forced entry. These glass solutions come in multiple protection levels, allowing schools to choose materials based on specific threats. Some institutions are also incorporating bullet-resistant interior partitions to create safe zones where students and staff can shelter in place if necessary. Security vestibules Security vestibules are becoming a standard feature in schools nationwide. These can take various forms, but they essentially provide a secure and fortified area with ballistic-rated windows, d"

It surfaced for the first time in late April 2023 and has since been publicly attributed to the APT actor Charming Kitten. One important aspect of the BellaCiao samples is how they exhibit a wealth of information through their respective PDB paths, including a versioning scheme we were able to work out once we analyzed historical records. Recently, we were investigating an intrusion that involved a BellaCiao sample (MD5 14f6c034af7322156e62a6c961106a8c) on a computer in Asia. Our telemetry indicated another suspicious, and possibly related, sample on the same machine. After further investigation of the sample, it turned out to be a reimplementation of an older BellaCiao version, but written in C++. BellaCiao: PDB analysis BellaCiao has very descriptive PDB paths that expose important points related to the campaign, such as the target entity and country. In addition, after analyzing several historical samples, we found that all PDB paths contained the string “MicrosoftAgentServices”. Some of the samples had a single digit appended to the string, as in “MicrosoftAgentServices2” and “MicrosoftAgentServices3”. The use of integers typically indicates versioning employed by the malware developer, likely to differentiate various iterations or updates. These versioning practices may serve the purpose of tracking development and changes in the malware’s capabilities, aiding the APT actor in maintaining a diverse and evolving arsenal to achieve their objectives. Below are the last 10 samples with their respective compilation times. md5 Partial PDB Compiler Timestamp 4"

Our analysis uncovered new components used in these attacks, including a novel service injector designed to inject the backdoor into a running service. Additionally, we discovered previously undocumented components (plugins) deployed after the backdoor’s installation. These enabled a range of malicious activities such as deploying additional payloads, exploring file systems, executing command shells and more. The key plugins can be categorized in terms of their functionality into the following groups: Plugin Orchestrator, File System Manipulation, Remote Access Manager, Process Exploration, Network Connection Listing and Service Management. In this blog, we provide a detailed analysis of the EAGERBEE backdoor’s capabilities, focusing on the service injector, Plugin Orchestrator module and associated plugins. We also explore potential connections of the EAGERBEE backdoor with the CoughingDown threat group. Initial infection and spread Unfortunately, the initial access vector used by the attackers remains unclear. However, we observed them executing commands to deploy the backdoor injector named “tsvipsrv.dll” along with the payload file ntusers0.dat, using the SessionEnv service to run the injector, as can be seen below. //change the creation, last access and write time, timestamp of the file to \"1/8/2019 9:57\" attrib.exe -s -h -a C:\\users\\public\\ntusers0.dat powershell.exe -Command \"='1/8/2019 9:57'"

In all cases, infection occurred immediately after the victim clicked on a link in a phishing email, and the attackers’ website was opened using the Google Chrome web browser. No further action was required to become infected. All malicious links were personalized and had a very short lifespan. However, Kaspersky’s exploit detection and protection technologies successfully identified the zero-day exploit that was used to escape Google Chrome’s sandbox. We quickly analyzed the exploit code, reverse-engineered its logic, and confirmed that it was based on a zero-day vulnerability affecting the latest version of Google Chrome. We then reported the vulnerability to the Google security team. Our detailed report enabled the developers to quickly address the issue, and on March 25, 2025, Google released an update fixing the vulnerability and thanked us for discovering this attack. Acknowledgement for finding CVE-2025-2783 (excerpt from security fixes included into Chrome 134.0.6998.177/.178) We have discovered and reported dozens of zero-day exploits actively used in attacks, but this particular exploit is certainly one of the most interesting we’ve encountered. The vulnerability CVE-2025-2783 really left us scratching our heads, as, without doing anything obviously malicious or forbidden, it allowed the attackers to bypass Google Chrome’s sandbox protection as if it didn’t even exist. The cause of this was a logical error at the intersection of Google Chrome’s sandbox and the Windows operating system. We plan to publish the technical details of this vulnerability once the majority of users have installed the updated version of the browser that fixes it. Our research is still ongoing, but jud"

Over the years, the global community has managed to publish a tremendous number of projects with freely accessible code that can be viewed and enhanced by anyone on the planet. Very frequently, code published on the Internet serves as a source of inspiration for software developers – whenever they need to implement a project feature, they often check whether the code they need is already available online. This way, they avoid reinventing the wheel and thus save their precious time. With more and more open-source projects being published, both state-sponsored actors and cybercriminals started using freely available code as a lure to infect their targets. Of course, this trend shows no sign of slowing down as evidenced by a currently active campaign aimed at GitHub users that we dubbed GitVenom. Promise-filled yet fake projects Over the course of the GitVenom campaign, the threat actors behind it have created hundreds of repositories on GitHub that contain fake projects with malicious code – for example, an automation instrument for interacting with Instagram accounts, a Telegram bot allowing to manage Bitcoin wallets, and a hacking tool for the video game Valorant. Clearly, in designing these fake projects, the actors went to great lengths to make the repositories appear legitimate to potential targets. For instance, the malicious repositories we discovered contained well-designed README.md files, possibly generated using AI tools. We observed these files to contain "

Although the number of registered vulnerabilities continued to rise, the total number of Proof of Concept (PoC) instances decreased compared to 2023. Among notable techniques in Q4, attackers leveraged undocumented RPC interfaces and targeted the Windows authentication mechanism. Statistics on registered vulnerabilities This section contains statistics on registered vulnerabilities. Data is sourced from the CVE portal: cve.org. Total number of registered vulnerabilities and number of critical ones, Q4 2023 vs. Q4 2024 (download) In Q4 2024, the trend of documenting software flaws that create vulnerabilities continued to gain momentum. The share of vulnerabilities labeled as critical was slightly higher than in Q4 2023. In general, more and more vulnerabilities are being assigned CVE identifiers through Bug Bounty programs and general software security research. Let’s also examine the number of public exploits. Number of vulnerabilities, the share of critical ones, and those for which exploits exist, 2019–2024 (download) As shown in the graph, the number of published exploits for vulnerabilities ended up at around 6%, which is 4 p.p. lower than in 2023. This decline may be due to vendors’ requirements not to disclose information about exploitation methods for discovered vulnerabilities and "

In it, we described activities that had mostly happened in the first half of the year. We tried to draw attention to the group, which was aggressively extending its activities beyond their typical targets, infecting government entities, logistics companies and maritime infrastructures in South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. We also shared further information about SideWinder&#8217;s post-exploitation activities and described a new sophisticated implant designed specifically for espionage.</p>\n<p>We continued to monitor the group throughout the rest of the year, observing intense activity that included updates to SideWinder&#8217;s toolset and the creation of a massive new infrastructure to spread malware and control compromised systems. The targeted sectors were consistent with those we had seen in the first part of 2024, but we noticed a new and significant increase in attacks against maritime infrastructures and logistics companies.</p>\n<p>In 2024, we initially observed a significant number of attacks in Djibouti. Subsequently, the attackers shifted their focus to other entities in Asia and showed a strong interest in targets within Egypt.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we observed other attacks that indicated a specific interest in nuclear power plants and nuclear energy in South Asia and further expansion of activities into new countries, especially in Africa.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115868\" style="

These tools often include features such as in-memory module execution and encrypted command-and-control (C2) communication, giving attackers flexibility while minimizing their footprint. This article walks through a SOC investigation where efficient surface-level analysis led to the identification of a web shell associated with a well-known toolset commonly associated with Chinese-speaking threat actors. Despite being a much-discussed tool, it is still used by the attackers for post-exploitation activities, thanks to its modular design and adaptability. We’ll break down the investigative process, detail how the analysts uncovered the web shell family, and highlight practical detection strategies to help defenders identify similar threats. Onset It’s early Monday morning, almost 4am UTC time, and the apparent nighttime calm inside the SOC is abruptly interrupted by an alert from our SIEM. It indicates that Kaspersky Endpoint Security’s heuristic engine has detected a web shell (HEUR:Backdoor.MSIL.WebShell.gen) on the SharePoint server of a government infrastructure in Southeast Asia, a warning that no SOC analyst would want to ignore.

From banking apps weaponized to steal personal data, to trusted domains abused for redirecting users to phishing traps, cybercriminals didn’t hold back. Their tactics are growing more creative and more dangerous. Here’s a breakdown of the three standout attacks that made headlines this month. 1. Fake Banking App Targeting Android Users via Telegram A sophisticated malware dropper was spotted mimicking the IndusInd Bank app, targeting Android users in a phishing scheme aimed at stealing sensitive financial information. Once installed, the malicious app displays a fake banking interface, tricking users into entering critical details like their mobile number, Aadhaar and PAN numbers, and net banking credentials. After the victims submit the data, it is sent to both a phishing server and a Telegram-controlled command and control (C2) channel. The APK itself contains base.apk, the core malicious payload, and has permissions to install other apps. The dropper is also obfuscated and uses XOR-encryption with a key (“npmanager”) to conceal its code and behavior. You can see a real-world sample of this attack in ANY.RUN’s new Android sandbox: View analysis session Banking app interface displayed inside ANY.RUN sandbox Inside the sandbox, let’s explore the actual interface of the fake banking app and trace how the attack unfolds. By following the process tree and network connections, you can observe how a user was tricked into submitting their credentials. Sensitive information entered by the user Network activity also reveals how the stolen data is sent to a phishing site, then forwarded to a Telegram-controlled command server. Communication with Telegram captured by ANY"

Active Directory (AD) password reset requests are one of the most common issues service desks have to deal with but can be a major vulnerability as they are open to bad actors attempting to impersonate real users using tactics like social engineering. Good password hygiene is easy enough to implement in AD but service desks must also be able to securely verify that users making the requests are who they say they are, not relying on an insecure method like an employee ID number, but enforcing a secure verification process with no exceptions, not even the executive team. Specops specializes in password management and authentication solutions and its Secure Service Desk offering provides the tools for helpdesk agents to securely verify users’ identities before performing password resets, changes or account unlocks. Snapping in seamlessly with AD, it can enforce user authentication and doesn’t require users to enroll as it leverages personal information present in their account attributes such as email addresses, mobile numbers or an existing identity service the user is already enrolled with. Along with sending one-time passwords (OTPs) via mobile SMS and email, it supports many other identity services including Okta Verify, Symantec VIP and Duo Security. More importantly, it employs multi-factor authentication (MFA) and a smart weighting feature to verify the identity of administrators and service desk agents when they access the Secure Service Desk portal.

        "raw_content": "Cybersecurity has always needed to be a forward-thinking industry, given the fast-paced nature of the job and rapidly evolving threats. So why has the industry struggled for so long to shake off its reputation of being an impenetrable boy’s club? Misconceptions (such as the lingering caricatured image of men coding in hoodies) have alienated a huge segment of the population from even considering a career move into the field – notably women. In 2022, a KnowBe4-sponsored report found that women only make up 25% of the cybersecurity workforce, up a staggering 15% on 2013. Clearly work is being done to break down the barriers of entry into cybersecurity but more needs to be done. Now is the time to pick up momentum. One of the crucial elements of making cybersecurity appeal to women is to show them the possibilities, by highlighting role models for them to aspire to. Specifically, role models who have had demonstrable success in the sector or are driving the changes necessary to redress the current imbalance. This is why we’ve created the Most Inspiring Women in Cyber Awards. We can’t be what we can’t see. We ask the public to nominate candidates from around the globe, with the final Top 20 Women selected by an esteemed panel of judges. A profile on each of these Top 20 Women is then published with our media partner, the IT Security Guru, which receives over 45,000 views every month. Now in its 5th year, the awards are set to take place on the 26th of February at the spectacular BT Tower, thanks to BT’s continued support of the event. During the awards ceremony, panel discussions take place featuring some of the biggest names in the industry. These conversations stretch far further than gender. It’s also a chance for up-and-coming talent to ask questions and network. This year, we’ve introduced a new award in memory of our friend and colleague Paula Brici: The Paula Brici Cyber Marketeer of the Year Award. This award is open to all in-house women in marketing within cyb"

        "raw_content": "This year’s Global Cyber Summit at the International Cyber Expo boasted an impressive array of speakers from across the public and private sectors, curated by the team at SASIG. The overarching theme of this year’s Global Cyber Summit was ‘resilience’. One notable talk that called for greater industry resilience was Digital Secure By Design on day two. The session, chaired by Ciaran Martin CB, Oxford University Professor and Former CEO of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), explored the Security by Design initiative, which is supported by the UK government and seeks to transform digital technology and create a more resilient and secure foundation for future tech. The discussion centred around the question: How do we design a more robust ecosystem that is not susceptible to the vagaries of patching and zero-day vulnerabilities? With speed to market a priority for most organisations, and a lack of regulation to control the security of this process, software and hardware are often sent to market as insecure. Security by design should be the base standard for software and hardware development. Speakers on the panel included Agata Samojlowicz, Deputy Challenge Director at DsBD, Michelle Kradolfer, National SBD Manager, Police CPI, and Jake Verma, CTO of Quantaco. Why is the Secure by Design initiative important? According to Kradolfer, it’s important that “ecosystems of devices” (across home and work) are secure for people, organisations and countries. This must be done in collaboration with manufacturers too. Samojlowicz noted: “computers are currently insecure by design”. The strong case for building securely by design is hard to ignore. Standards are becoming increasingly more important in all sectors, so why not standardise and regulate the building of software and hardware? The industry surely has a responsibility to protect consumers. Kradolfer notes that there are already “too many insecure devices out there”. The panellists did think that IoT security is m"

AccuKnox, Inc., announced that Telecom and FinTech Leader IDT Corporation has partnered with AccuKnox to deploy Zero Trust CNAPP. Gartner’s predictions for the Internet of Things (IoT) security landscape in 2025 highlight the impact of AI Agent Abuse Leading to Security Breaches: By 2028, Gartner forecasts that 25% of enterprise security breaches will be traced back to the misuse of AI agents by both external and internal malicious actors. This underscores the need for enhanced security measures to monitor and control AI-driven activities. In response to the growing threats, by 2028, 40% of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are expected to implement technologies that autonomously track, oversee, or contain the actions of AI agents. This proactive approach aims to mitigate risks associated with AI-driven operations. The findings underscore the necessity of implementing robust security measures as IoT technologies continue to be integrated across multiple industries. AccuKnox runtime-powered CNAPP has the following differentiating features: Inline runtime security [as opposed to post-attack mitigation] Process micro-segmentation, OS hardening Flexible deployment – SAAS, On-Premises Application hardening Small footprint to support Edge/IoT deployment Support for Bare-Metal, Virtual Machine Multi-tenant, MSSP ready Powered by KubeArmor Open Source Project – a CNCF OpenSource project that delivers inline runtime security and has achieved 1.5M+ downloads, 1,600 GitHub stars Supporting Quotes “We are thrilled to partner with a leader like IDT Telecom and deliver runtime powered Zero Trust CNAPP to secure their Edge/IoT Assets.

        "raw_content": "Palo Alto, USA, March 28th, 2025, CyberNewsWire From WannaCry to the MGM Resorts Hack, ransomware remains one of the most damaging cyberthreats to plague enterprises. Chainalysis estimates that corporations spend nearly $1 billion dollars on ransom each year, but the greater cost often comes from the reputational damage and operational disruption caused by the attack. Ransomware attacks typically involve tricking victims into downloading and installing the ransomware, which copies, encrypts, and/or deletes critical data on the device, only to be restored upon the ransom payment. Traditionally, the primary target of ransomware has been the victim’s device. However, thanks to the proliferation of the cloud and SaaS services, the device no longer holds the keys to the kingdom. Instead, the browser has become the primary way through which employees conduct work and interact with the internet. In other words, the browser is becoming the new endpoint. SquareX has been disclosing major browser vulnerabilities like Polymorphic Extensions and Browser Syncjacking, and is now issuing a strong warning on the emergence of browser-native ransomware. SquareX’s founder, Vivek Ramachandran cautions, “With the recent surge in browser-based identity attacks like the one we saw with the Chrome Store OAuth attack, we are beginning to see evidence of the ‘ingredients’ of browser-native ransomwares being used by adversaries. It is only a matter of time before one smart attacker figures out how to put all the pieces together. While EDRs and Anti-Viruses have played an unquestionably vital role in defending against traditional ransomware, the future of ransomware will no longer involve file downloads, making a browser-native solution a necessity to combat browser-native ransomwares.” Unlike traditional ransomware, browser-native ransomware requires no file download, rendering them completely undetectable by endpoint security solutions. Rather, this attack targets the victim’s digital identi"

        "raw_content": "Delaware, USA, April 2nd, 2025, CyberNewsWire Brinker, an innovative narrative intelligence platform dedicated to combating disinformation and influence campaigns, has been recognized as one of the “10 Most Promising Defense Tech Startups of 2025” by Défense Israel and Robel Innovations. This distinction underscores Brinker’s groundbreaking approach to safeguarding governments, enterprises, and NGOs from increasingly sophisticated narrative-based threats. Brinker’s proprietary technology identifies malicious narratives across platforms, languages, and geographies, performing automated OSINT investigations and providing real-time mitigation options at the press of a button—dramatically reducing the entire response process from weeks to minutes. In October 2024, Brinker was selected to join the prestigious Innofense program for dual-use startups, run by SOSA and MAF’AT (DDR&D), designed to strengthen collaboration between civilian and defense markets through joint technological innovation. Disinformation, identified by the World Economic Forum as the number one global risk, poses significant threats to social cohesion, democratic institutions, and economic stability. Brinker’s solutions not only protect organizations but also empower societies to effectively defend themselves from harmful domestic and foreign influence campaigns, positively impacting communities worldwide. Brinker was founded by Benny Schnaider, Daniel Ravner, and Oded Breiner, who realized that starting a company built fundamentally on AI, rather than merely adding AI as a feature, would level the playing field in the asymmetric war against disinformation—transforming it into a symmetrical one. “This recognition affirms our vision to reshape the OSINT landscape through battle-proven narrative intelligence technology,” said Daniel Ravner, CEO and Co-founder of Brinker. Brinker’s CTO and Co-founder Oded Breiner added, “Our patented LLM-driven analysis allows us to reveal and neutralize threats that tra"

        "raw_content": "As cloud computing usage increases, so too are cloud computing myths. Some of these myths have been popular since their advent and still exist. These misconceptions slow enterprises' operations, stoke fear and prevent innovation. Hence, decision-makers are finding it extremely difficult and are uncertain about moving to the cloud environment. Awareness of cloud computing misconceptions puts a company in a better position to benefit from this technology. How Does Cloud Migration Impact Business? As cyber-attacks increase and the technological landscape evolves, embracing the latest technologies to defend against these threats has become essential. Migrating to the cloud environment is a solution for increasing the security of business data and reducing cyber-attack risks. Cloud computing also allows automatic database backups and updates. The cloud service provider oversees these areas and ensures a smooth experience. Moreover, organizations can easily access data from anywhere, share it with the concerned person and receive feedback quickly. Using the cloud environment means the employees can work from anywhere by having an internet connection and collaborating meaningfully. However, even though many organizations tend to use security tools like VPNs and antiviruses, migrating to the cloud environment is difficult because of the myths surrounding it. Read here: Human Error the Leading Cause of Cloud Data Breaches Top Cloud Computing Misconceptions That Exist Today Cloud computing misconceptions continue to persist. As a result, organizations must dispel these misconceptions to leverage this technology and gain maximum benefits. Common cloud misconceptions are as follows: Myth#1. Reliance on a Single Cloud Provider With cloud infrastructure evolving rapidly, some enterprises believe that depending on a single cloud provider is wise. However, relying on a single cloud infrastructure for all apps and workloads is not the right thing to do. Most public cloud users are w"

        "raw_content": "With the exponential growth of data, propelled by the proliferation of digital technologies and the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), organizations face unprecedented challenges in preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their data assets. In this context, data leakage detection and response solutions have emerged as critical components of a robust cybersecurity strategy. And to address these concerns, businesses must utilize advanced techniques to detect and respond to data leaks and safeguard valuable data assets. Data Leak vs. Data Breach A leak and a breach both involve unauthorized data disclosure, although there are differences in manner, scale and impact. Typically, when there is a data breach, there must have been an intentional malicious effort by an unauthorized party to gain access to sensitive information. On the other hand, data leaks are accidental data exposures resulting from misconfigurations, system errors, insider threats, and inadequate security measures. However, being unintentional does not mean that data leaks pose less of a concern than data breaches. This has been demonstrated by the accidental release of the personal data of 10,000 serving police officers and civilian staff at the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) on August 8, 2023, raising huge safety fears for officers and their families. Either situation can have serious security and financial implications for any organization. Although data leaks typically have a limited scope of impact, massive data from a breach can easily result in a leak when the attacker dumps sensitive information on the internet. Causes of Data Leakage Some factors that contribute to data leakage within organizations include: Data storage, systems or network misconfiguration Insider threats and poor access management System crashes, bugs and errors Obsolete software and tools Social engineering attacks Zero-day vulnerabilities.

        "raw_content": "Adopting operational technology (OT) cloud solutions has presented organizations with new challenges and opportunities to protect their assets effectively. And with the rise in cyber-attacks on OT infrastructure, it has become evident that OT assets require robust protection similar to their IT counterparts. However, the complexity of OT security, coupled with the lack of visibility into connected devices, has hindered organizations’ abilities to mitigate threats effectively. OT Cloud and Security Issues Cloud innovations are everywhere now. And hitherto exclusively physical infrastructure systems now have cloud integrations that enable seamless interactions across the ecosystem. And this cuts across all areas of OT use. Even when it comes to customer service, which operational industries cannot avoid, a cloud contact center, for instance, offers better security that’s integrated across the ecosystem compared to on-premises solutions. Across OTs, how have the attendant risks been managed, though? In fact, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the risk of attacks on OT, and the spate has not reduced since. In particular, many organizations are only warming up to the fact that OT assets need as much, if not more protection than IT systems. Yet, if the past few years of rising attacks have taught us anything, the stakes of a breach in OT cybersecurity are much higher and more disruptive than an IT incident. So, with the cybersecurity measures for OT systems still in the early stages, the challenges are compounded. According to Mckinsey, these challenges manifest on multiple fronts, including technical, operational, and investment management. OT Security Complexity According to an OT cybersecurity report, 72% of organizations surveyed claimed to experience some form of cybersecurity complexity, which hampers their effectiveness at mitigating threats. And the most common type of OT incident reported occurs through phishing emails, a simple attack that has significantly disru"

Download the Full Report – Steve Morgan, Founder of Cybersecurity Ventures Sausalito, Calif. – Apr. 2, 2025 Ransomware, the fastest growing type of cybercrime, is 35 years old, it shows no signs of slowing down, and it’s predicted to cost victims around $275 billion annually by 2031, according to Cybersecurity Ventures, with a new attack every 2 seconds as perpetrators progressively refine their malware payloads and related extortion activities. Ransomware costs include ransom negotiations and payouts, damage and destruction of data, stolen money, downtime, lost productivity, theft of intellectual property, theft of personal and financial data, embezzlement, fraud, post-attack disruption to the normal course of business, forensic investigation, restoration and deletion of hacked data and systems, reputational harm, legal costs, and potentially, regulatory fines.

Adam Keown, CISO at Kingsport, Tenn.-based Eastman (NYSE: EMN), a Fortune 500 global specialty materials company, told Cybersecurity Ventures that “ransomware is a top tier concern for all CISOs at large enterprises,” and that “AI has a strong potential to make ransomware more sophisticated by automating or optimizing different attack vectors.” “Ransomware isn’t just an IT issue—it’s a boardroom crisis waiting to happen,” said Najaf Husain, founder and CEO of Elastio, a leading provider of ransomware recovery assurance. “Executives must ensure their organizations can recover, or risk catastrophic financial and reputational damage,” added Husain, a well respected cybersecurity expert and entrepreneur who has wat"

        "raw_content": "A major new cybersecurity law set to come into force later this year will demand new compliance requirements of 1000 UK organizations, the government said today. The Cyber Security and Resilience Bill is the government’s long-awaited answer to the EU’s NIS2 – a new piece of legislation that builds on the European NIS Directive of 2016. The UK’s interpretation of that directive, known as NIS Regulations 2018, has been due an update for several years. At the time of writing, the full policy statement on the proposed bill has not been published. However, the government said that if all of its proposals are adopted, they will: Bring into scope more organizations and suppliers, including datacenter operators and managed service providers (MSPs), that will be expected to improve risk assessments, data protection and network security Give regulators “more tools” to help them raise security standards Mandate more detailed incident reporting, expected to include ransomware breaches Grant the government more powers to update regulatory frameworks when needed, to make rules fit for purpose as threats and technology environments evolve and new sectors require regulating NCSC CEO, Richard Horne, described the legislation as a “landmark moment” that will help to enhance the cyber resilience of countless critical infrastructure sectors such as water, power and healthcare. “It is a pivotal step toward stronger, more dynamic regulation, one that not only keeps up with emerging threats but also makes it as challenging as possible for our adversaries,” he added. “By bolstering their cyber defenses and engaging with the NCSC’s guidance and tools, such as Cyber Assessment Framework, Cyber Essentials, and Active Cyber Defence, organizations of all sizes will be better prepared to meet the increasingly sophisticated challenges.” Read more on cyber resilience legislation: UK Government Set to Introduce New Cyber Security and Resilience Bill The government claimed cyber-threats cost the UK "

        "raw_content": "Cybercriminals have ramped up their use of lookalike domains to facilitate a variety of targeted email-based social engineering and financial fraud scams, according to a new report by BlueVoyant. These attacks are particularly challenging to detect and enable attackers to extend the types of organizations and individuals who are targeted in such scams. The researchers found that threat actors target a range of critical sectors via such domains, including finance, legal services, insurance and construction. Lookalike cases reported per month relating to a well known American financial services company between January 2024 to January 2025. Source: BlueVoyantLookalike domains are designed to closely resemble authentic domains, using subtle alterations to appear legitimate to victims. Common approaches include the use of visually similar characters, such as replacing an “o” with a “0” or an “I” with a “1”, and incorporating terms closely related to the client’s brand. Additionally, the use of different top-level domains (TLDs) allows the domain name to be almost exact copies of the original, but with a different TLD. Attacks that leverage lookalike domain scams typically begin with the registration of a domain that closely resembles a well-known brand. After securing the domain, the attackers set up email servers to facilitate the distribution of deceptive communications. They will then compile a list of potential victims, often using information gathered from public sources, previous data breaches or social media. This information allows them to tailor their communications to specific organizations and individuals. Finally, social engineering emails will be sent to the targets from the lookalike domain, using a range of tactics to deceive recipients into providing sensitive information, authorizing payments or clicking on malicious links. Threat Actors Conducting Variety of Lookalike Campaigns The report highlighted several recent campaigns leveraging lookalike domains"

        "raw_content": "A new cyber campaign using fake job interviews to target cryptocurrency professionals has been uncovered by security researchers. The operation, dubbed “ClickFake Interview,” was attributed to the North Korean Lazarus Group and involves social engineering tactics to distribute malicious software. According to a report published by Sekoia today, the attack chain begins with fraudulent job postings on platforms like LinkedIn or X (formerly Twitter). Threat actors posing as recruiters contact professionals in the cryptocurrency sector, inviting them to interviews. During the process, victims are tricked into opening malicious documents or clicking on compromised links, ultimately leading to malware infection. The malware, identified as “ClickFix,” enables remote access to the victim’s system, allowing Lazarus to steal sensitive data, including cryptocurrency wallet credentials. The campaign is a continuation of the Group’s long-running strategy of targeting financial institutions and cryptocurrency entities to fund the North Korean regime. Read more on how cybercriminals exploit social engineering tactics: 92% of Organizations Hit by Credential Compromise from Social Engineering Attacks Sekoia highlighted that Lazarus has adapted its techniques over time, incorporating sophisticated deception strategies. In this campaign, the group used genuine-looking documents and engaged in full-fledged interview conversations mimicking legitimate hiring processes to enhance credibility. Once the malicious tool is installed, attackers can execute arbitrary commands, exfiltrate data and maintain persistent access to compromised systems. Protecting Against ClickFake Attacks Indicators of compromise (IOCs) linked to ClickFake include specific domains, hashes and malware signatures. “A particular element of ClickFake Interview is that fake job offers are designed to attract profiles different from software developers and engineers,” Sekoia warned. “This may reflect a new Lazarus strateg"

        "raw_content": "A new malware variant dubbed RESURGE has been uncovered by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and is targeting Ivanti Connect Secure appliances through a critical vulnerability. The malware leverages a stack-based buffer overflow flaw, CVE-2025-0282, to create web shells, manipulate system files and survive system reboots. CISA’s analysis, revealed that RESURGE shares functionality with the prior SPAWNCHIMERA malware but introduces unique commands to enhance its stealth and persistence. RESURGE’s capabilities include embedding web shells for credential harvesting, modifying coreboot images to maintain access and evading integrity checks. The malware injects itself into legitimate processes, creating SSH tunnels for command-and-control (C2) communication. It also copies malicious components to the Ivanti boot disk, ensuring persistence even after restarts. CISA noted RESURGE’s ability to execute arbitrary commands, including password resets and privilege escalation. The malware was found alongside a variant of the SPAWNSLOTH log-tampering tool and a custom binary “dsmain,” which incorporates BusyBox utilities. dsmain enables attackers to decrypt and repackage coreboot images, embedding malicious payloads. The analysis also identified RESURGE’s use of open-source tools like extract_vmlinux.sh to modify kernel images, further complicating detection. CVE-2025-0282 was added to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on January 8 2025 and affects Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure and ZTA Gateways. Attackers exploit this flaw to gain initial access, after which RESURGE deploys its full toolkit. CISA urges immediate action, recommending: Factory resets for compromised devices, using clean images for cloud systems Resetting credentials for all accounts, including the krbtgt account (responsible for handling Kerberos ticket requests and encrypting and signing them) twice, with replication delays Temporarily revoking or reducing privilege"

        "raw_content": "Two high-risk security vulnerabilities in the WP Ultimate CSV Importer plugin for WordPress have been discovered by security researchers. These flaws, potentially affecting over 20,000 websites, allow authenticated users with subscriber-level access or higher to upload arbitrary files and delete critical site files, enabling attackers to achieve complete site compromise. The vulnerabilities, an arbitrary file upload and an arbitrary file deletion flaw, affect versions up to 7.19 of WP Ultimate CSV Importer. According to a new advisory by Wordfence, attackers exploiting these flaws can achieve remote code execution or force a site into a compromised setup state. The arbitrary file upload vulnerability (CVE-2025-2008) has a CVSS score of 8.8. The flaw stems from the import_single_post_as_csv() function of the CSV Importer plugin, which lacks proper file type validation allowing attackers to upload malicious PHP files that can execute code remotely and potentially lead to full site takeover. Meanwhile, the arbitrary file deletion flaw (CVE-2025-2007) has a CVSS score of 8.1. In this case, the deleteImage() function lacks sufficient file path validation, enabling attackers to delete arbitrary files, including wp-config.php, which forces a site reset and allows hijacking of the setup process. Read more on attacks exploiting lack of proper file validation: Flaw in AI Plugin Exposes 50,000 WordPress Sites to Remote Attack These vulnerabilities were reported through the Wordfence Bug Bounty Program by researcher “mikemyers.” Wordfence disclosed the vulnerabilities to the plugin’s developers, Smackcoders, on March 5 2025. The vendor acknowledged the report on March 7, and a fully patched version, 7.19.1, was released on March 25 2025. “We encourage WordPress users to verify that their sites are updated to the latest patched version of WP Ultimate CSV Importer as soon as possible considering the critical nature of these vulnerabilities,” Wordfence said.

        "raw_content": "A new sophisticated phishing attack leveraging vishing, remote access tools and DLL sideloading has been uncovered by threat analysts. The attack, observed by Ontinue’s Cyber Defence Centre (CDC) and discussed in an advisory published today, exploited Microsoft Teams and Quick Assist to gain initial access, ultimately deploying a JavaScript-based command-and-control (C2) backdoor. Multi-Stage Attack Breakdown The attack begins with a vishing scheme conducted through Teams, creating an opportunity for a signed binary to bypass security measures. “The attacker sideloaded a malicious DLL that dynamically commandeered a trusted process, transforming routine remote support into a covert entry point,” explained Jason Soroko, senior fellow at Sectigo. Once inside, the attackers executed a signed TeamViewer.exe file to sideload a malicious DLL, TV.dll. This allowed them to establish persistence by generating an LNK file in the Start-up folder and executing commands remotely via a JavaScript-based backdoor. Threat researchers at Ontinue noted similarities between this attack and previous campaigns attributed to Storm-1811, a group known for using vishing and Quick Assist to infiltrate networks. Though attribution remains unconfirmed, tactics such as abusing signed binaries, DLL sideloading and leveraging Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) jobs for persistence align with known Storm-1811 methodologies. Read more on Storm-1811: Windows Quick Assist Exploited in Ransomware Attacks The Role of AI in Phishing Attacks J Stephen Kowski, field CTO at SlashNext, highlighted the evolving nature of social engineering attacks. “The latest Ontinue research on multi-stage attacks using vishing and Microsoft Teams demonstrates how threat actors are getting more creative with AI-powered voice cloning to trick users,” Kowski said. “Real-time scanning across all communication channels, not just email, is essential since these attacks often start with social engineering before depl"

        "raw_content": "The UK’s data protection regulator has said it is committed to getting back on track after complaint response times plummeted in the past quarter. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) admitted staff have been overwhelmed by a surge in data protection complaints from the public. It claimed to have received 746 more of these between October and December 2024 than in the same period a year previously. “Anyone who has felt the need to make a complaint to us deserves a timely response. Our current response times are not where we want them to be, and we know how frustrating this is for people who are asking for our help,” it said in a statement yesterday. \"We are committed to getting back to meeting our target of responding to 80% of complaints within 90 days and are introducing several initiatives over the coming months that we believe will help us to achieve this. This includes recruiting 19 staff to help us deal with the ongoing increase in complaints that we are seeing each month.” Read more on data protection regulation: ICO Set to Scale Back Public Sector Fines According to the ICO’s own figures, it responded to just 12% of complaints within 90 days in the last three months of 2024, way short of its 80% commitment. The figure has dropped each quarter since Q4 2023. At the start of 2024 it was 65%. The surge in complaints could be viewed optimistically as a success, in that more data subjects are aware of their rights under the GDPR/Data Protection Act 2018. However, it may also highlight that corporate data protection failings are on the rise. The ICO said it received over 10,000 complaints in the final quarter of 2024 – an 8% annual increase. “We expect performance against this measure will continue to slide until we are in a position to roll out significant digital and process changes,” it admitted. “Plans to transform the way we deal with customer complaints are in train with a staged roll-out planned once we have consulted on them.

        "raw_content": "Steam was the most phished brand in the first quarter of 2025, marking a first for the gaming community, according to new data from Guardio. The security vendor’s analysis of customer emails and texts found Steam was the most spoofed brand “by a significant margin,” beating usual suspects Microsoft and Meta into second and third place respectively. “Scammers have been targeting the massive gaming community by impersonating Steam to warn users about supposed account issues, like payment failures or suspicious login attempts. These fake messages are designed to trick victims into entering their login credentials on counterfeit websites, which then steal their account information,” it warned. “Some phishing attempts will also claim you’ve won a Steam gift card or a special promotion, prompting you to click on fraudulent links to claim your prize.” Read more on phishing: Phishing Attacks Double in 2024 Another first in Q1 2025 was the appearance of US toll road operators in the top 10. Three separate brands made it onto the list: EZDrive Massachusetts E-ZPass, which operates toll roads across 20 states SunPass, which operates in Florida Guardio claimed to have detected a 604% increase in toll fee scam texts since the start of the year, with the week beginning March 2 recording a 98% jump from the previous week. “Scammers have been sending out text messages claiming you have an unpaid toll fee, directing victims to fake websites designed to steal sensitive information,” it said. “These scams are particularly dangerous as they exploit the urgency of unpaid tolls, tricking victims into entering payment details on fraudulent sites without thinking twice. Always verify toll notices through official channels, and never click on suspicious links.” Rounding out the top 10 in the first three months of the year were Roblox, USPS, Netflix and WeTransfer. Guardio also warned of a surge in phishing messages impersonating the IRS and other tax services, as well as retailers like Joan"

        "raw_content": "Google today announced a major new initiative set to boost corporate security, compliance and data sovereignty efforts, by making end-to-end encryption (E2EE) available to all users. Announced on the anniversary of the launch of Gmail, the plan is to roll out E2EE in beta – first to users within the same organization, then all Gmail users, and finally users of any email service. The tech giant explained that it has worked hard behind the scenes to overcome the technical complexity traditionally associated with encrypting email data at rest and in transit. “The Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) is a protocol that enables sending digitally signed and encrypted messages. It is typically used for highly sensitive emails among regulated organizations, such as government agencies and businesses that work with them,” Google said. “While more organizations have real needs for E2EE emails, few have the resources to implement S/MIME. IT teams need to acquire and manage certificates and deploy them to each user, resulting in additional efforts and costs. And end users have to figure out whether they and the recipient have S/MIME configured (few do) and then go through the hassle of exchanging certificates before the encrypted emails can be exchanged.” Read more on E2EE: Experts Dismayed at UK’s Apple Decryption Demands Alternatives to S/MIME might require sharing of encryption keys with email providers, undermining data privacy and increasing sovereignty risks, Google added. Proprietary point solutions might introduce extra complexity, requiring custom apps, portals or browser extensions. Google claimed its E2EE service can be enabled in “just a few clicks” without the need to exchange custom certificates or use specialized software. Because encryption keys are controlled by the customer and not the provider, it is extra secure. While the experience is seamless for recipients who are Gmail users, those who aren’t will receive an invitation to view an E2EE e"

        "raw_content": "The recent cyber-attack that disrupted Ukraine’s railway systems was conducted by Russian-backed hackers, according to the Ukrainian government. The attack occurred on March 24 and took down the online ticketing system of Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukraine’s state-owned railway company. Yevheniia Nakonechna, Head of the State Cyber Protection Centre of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP), gave a press briefing on the restoration of Ukrzaliznytsia’s services on April 1. She relayed the conclusions of the Government Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA), whose investigation found that the attack employed tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) “characteristic of Russian intelligence services.” Furthermore, the cybercriminals utilized unique malware designed “with the attacked infrastructure’s specifics in mind.” Suggesting that the execution of such a cyber-attack required significant resources for preparation. Ukraine: A Cyber-Attack on Critical Infrastructure is “An Act of Terrorism” Nakonechna called the cyber-attack “an act of terrorism.” “Disrupting the ticket sales system significantly impacted public services. The enemy clearly understands that these types of cyber-attacks are extremely painful and critical,” she said. Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, Chairman of the Board of Ukrzaliznytsia, said that the website for purchasing tickets and the mobile application are now fully operational. “The cyber-attack on the company was targeted and meticulously planned. However, not a single Ukrzaliznytsia train was halted for even a moment. This was due to well-prepared algorithms and procedures,” he added. He also emphasized that there had been no data breaches of personal information. Several Ukrainian government agencies assisted Ukrzaliznytsia in investigating and remedying the attack, as well as restoring systems, including CERT-UA, the SSSCIP’s State Cyber Protection Center and the Cybersecurity Department of the "

PHOTO: Wikipedia. 01 Oct Hacking Before The Internet Posted at 09:10h in Blogs, Videos by Cybercrime Magazine Phone phreaks manipulated the world’s largest machine, and company – David Braue Melbourne, Australia – Feb. 13, 2024 For a generation of today’s youths raised on smartphones, multi megabit downloads and digital home phones before them, the idea that the phone system was once primitive enough that it could be manipulated with a plastic toy whistle is at once both strange and tantalizing. But that’s exactly what happened back in the 1970s, when natural curiosity about evolving phone networks birthed a generation of inquisitive “phone phreaks” who spent considerable time and energy poking and prodding the phone network to see what was going on behind that rotary handset. They were the precursors to today’s network hackers, sharing tips and tactics not by closed and encrypted message groups but by printed newsletters distributed by mail. More than anything it was, erstwhile phreaker Phil Lapsley recently told Cybercrime Magazine, a time of discovery. “I’m a curious person, which is one of the hallmarks of phone phreaks,” explained Lapsley, whose 2014 book Exploding the Phone traces his journey through the phreaking world. “It was really just a wonderful thing to explore and understand the telephone network and the technology behind it.” The technology behind the evolving phone system was the byproduct of an effort to increase the automation of that system — which had previously relied on calls being routed by human operators — that began in the 1940s and rapidly evolved into a massively complex, interconnected network in which, Lapsley said, users “were directly controlling the phone system.” Customers “were starting to interconnect these things to this kind of magical combination of humans as customers, telephones as machines, telephone switching equipment as machines, and then more humans — typically operators — and technicians and engineers de"

PHOTO: Cybercrime Magazine. 28 Jul Ransomware’s Rising Tide Is Threatening To Capsize Small Businesses Posted at 16:38h in Blogs, Videos by Cybercrime Magazine Global damage costs predicted to exceed $10 billion in 2021 – David Braue Melbourne, Australia – Jul. 28, 2021 SMALL BUSINESS REPORT Among its many repercussions, the recent compromise of IT service provider Kaseya left an estimated 1,500 companies — most of them small businesses — struggling to recover after their systems were locked by ransomware in a vicious supply chain attack. The breach was the latest in a series of high-profile attacks this year, but its impact on small businesses, in particular, was a reminder that cyberattacks are an equal-opportunity plague. And for every ransomware hit on software suppliers like Kaseya, or every compromise of major multinationals like Saudi Aramco, thousands of small businesses are suffering similar disruption — usually without the support of dedicated cybersecurity teams or expensive backup and recovery infrastructure. The results can be catastrophic: Cybersecurity Ventures predicts ransomware damages will cost the world $20 billion in 2021, and grow to $265 billion by 2031. With small businesses globally being victims to more than half of all cyberattacks, the total ransomware damage costs they’ll sustain is estimated to exceed $10 billion. Cybercrime Radio: Small Businesses at Cyber Risk Johan Gerber, EVP Security & Cyber Innovation at MasterCard This sort of financial loss can drown small businesses — 88 percent of whom, a recent U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) survey found, admit they are vulnerable to a cyberattack. The increasing vulnerability of small businesses was reflected in the 2021 Verizon Business Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), which noted that small businesses were targets in fewer than 50 percent as many breaches as large organizations — but that this had increased to 85 percent as many in 2020 amidst last year’s"

Cybersecurity Ventures predicts ransomware will attack a business, consumer, or device every two seconds and will cost victims $265 billion USD annually by 2031. Our goal with this report is to provide a window into the organized gangs who are planning and executing the attacks. Knowledge is power in the war against ransomware criminals. WHAT IS RANSOMWARE? Ransomware is a malware variant designed to deny a user access to their files or systems and is roughly separated into crypto and locker types — although many ransomware families today combine these capabilities and more. Once ransomware has successfully infected a target machine or network, its operators attempt to extort their victims. Individuals were once most at risk from ransomware hidden within malicious attachments to emails, suspicious links, and drive-by downloads, but now, organizations are, by far, the most lucrative and appealing targets to criminals. Today’s threat actors will use the lure of a decryption key (which may or may not work) to pressure the target into paying. Furthermore, businesses may find themselves subject to data theft-related extortion. Ransomware moves laterally across networks, often propagating to connected PCs and storage drives. Depending on the sophistication of the original programmer, various levels of encryption will be implemented to protect the malware from reverse engineering and to ensure victim systems are resistant to decryption efforts. Furthermore, ransomware families come in a variety of programming languages ranging from C++ to Rust and Golang (Go). Well-known ransomware variants and operators include Al"

Sponsored by BreachLock – Steve Morgan, Editor-in-Chief Sausalito, Calif. – Aug. 14, 2023 “If you’re spending one dollar on cybersecurity and you’re not doing penetration testing, then you’re doing something terribly wrong,” Seemant Sehgal, founder and CEO at BreachLock, told Cybersecurity Ventures. You can spend as much as you wish on perimeter and network defense, implementing zero-trust policies, training staff, and endpoint protection, but unless you consistently test the effectiveness of cybersecurity defense, potential pathways for exploitation remain open. Substantial and frequent penetration testing is crucial for modern businesses to mitigate the risk of cyberattacks today. Facts, figures, predictions and statistics help CISOs and cybersecurity leaders understand the market dynamics. 25 PEN TESTING MARKET STATISTICS Cybersecurity Ventures predicts the global penetration testing product and service market will exceed $5 billion annually by 2031. This is based on vetting and averaging market forecasts from numerous industry sources. 92 percent of U.S. and European organizations have increased their overall IT security spending this year, with 85 percent raising their penetration testing budgets, reports TechRepublic. By some estimates the global penetration testing market will grow more than 24 percent through 2026. In many cases annual penetration tests don’t happen. Budgets are one problem, as TechRepublic reports, with 1 in 3 companies citing money as their reason for not conducting the tests more frequently. The range of penetration testing can start as low as a few hundred dollars and on the upper end can even exceed $100,000. The cost of a penetration test for the average organization is $18,300. eSecurit"

Although the numbers listed below have been featured and quoted (with attribution to us as the source) by hundreds of major media outlets, vendors, academia, governments, associations, event producers, and industry experts — the material is all original research which first appeared in reports published by Cybersecurity Ventures. 1. Global cybercrime damage predicted to hit $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. If it were measured as a country, then cybercrime — which is predicted to inflict damages totaling $9.5 trillion USD globally in 2024 — would be the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China. Cybersecurity Ventures expects global cybercrime costs to grow by 15 percent over the next year, reaching $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion USD in 2015. This represents the greatest transfer of economic wealth in history, risks the incentives for innovation and investment, is exponentially larger than the damage inflicted from natural disasters in a year, and will be more profitable than the global trade of all major illegal drugs combined. Cybercrime costs include damage and destruction of data, stolen money, lost productivity, theft of intellectual property, theft of personal and financial data, embezzlement, fraud, post-attack disruption to the normal course of business, forensic investigation, restoration and deletion of hacked data and systems, and reputational harm. 2. Global cybersecurity spending will exceed $1.75 trillion cumulatively from 2021-2025.

Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that the total amount of data stored in the cloud — which includes public clouds operated by vendors and social media companies (think Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, etc.), government-owned clouds that are accessible to citizens and businesses, private clouds owned by mid-to-large-sized corporations, and cloud storage providers — will reach 100 zettabytes by 2025, or 50 percent of the world’s data at that time, up from approximately 25 percent stored in the cloud in 2015. Total global data storage is projected to exceed 200 zettabytes by 2025. This includes data stored on private and public IT infrastructures, on utility infrastructures, on private and public cloud data centers, on personal computing devices — PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones — and on IoT (Internet-of-Things) devices. With this exponential data growth the opportunities — for innovation, and for cybercrime — are incalculable because data is the building block of the digitized economy.

The availability of dial-up, broadband, fiber, and 4G/5G cellular connectivity has given rise to new businesses, jobs, and changes to how we communicate. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, there were six billion internet users in 2022.

An internship program, run by Hartsville, S.C.-based manufacturer Novolex in conjunction with the schools in Charlotte, N.C., has proven successful in establishing ties with local students that may, CISO Matt Burroughs told Cybercrime Magazine, end up working in cybersecurity one day. “The conversations that I am having with others is that there is this expectation that those coming out of school are able to start with an entry-level job in the field,” Burroughs explained. By engaging with students in their sophomore and junior years as part of the company internship program, he said, “we’re able to bring them in early. We have them get some level of understanding about what the actual industry looks like, to see if it’s something they actually want to lean into as they grow their careers.” The internship roles are hands-on, with one recent participant responsible for building Novolex’s phishing campaigns for the entire year. “It was cool for us because they brought a new lens to the overall campaigns that we are doing,” Burroughs explained. “They were able to take on the challenge and say ‘we’re going to try to phish people in really new ways.’ It was really helpful to have them come on.” Early engagement with potential cybersecurity workers is also helpful in planting the seeds of the soft skills that many employers see as hard to find in candidates these days. “I’m awa"

Cybersecurity Ventures estimates there are now at least 32,000 CISOs employed worldwide. Press Release The good news is that most large organizations have a CISO. The bad news is that most small businesses, and far too many mid-sized companies, have been left by the wayside and they do not have a dedicated full-time leader focused exclusively on cybersecurity. Zippia, established through a database of 30 million profiles and verified against Census Bureau data, estimates over 7,523 chief security officers (an interchangeable term with CISOs) are “currently employed” in the U.S. The 2022 Fortune 500 list suggests that the top businesses in the U.S. contribute approximately two-thirds of the country’s GDP in terms of revenue. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, 100 percent of Fortune 500 companies and the majority of Global 2000 organizations employed a CISO or an equivalent role in 2023, up from 70 percent in 2018. There are 31.7 million small businesses in the U.S., and SMBs account for 99.9 percent of them. Over 80 percent of SMBs are sole proprietors and have no employees. Despite this, 47 percent of the U.S. workforce is employed by small businesses. It is estimated that over 600,000 new small businesses are opened every year in the U.S., and 100 million small companies open annually, worldwide. Close to zero percent of these companies will employ a dedicated security officer, widening the chasm between adequate business protection and cyber threats every year.

The recent Gallup Global Digital Skills Study — which was sponsored by AWS and surveyed over 100 million job postings, 30,000 workers and 9000 employers in 19 countries — shed a considerable amount of light on the subject, with certifications found to be a clear way of standing out from the pack when applying for jobs. Overall, the study found, candidates with technology certifications were more likely to be hired than individuals without one: having a technology certification made it 38 percent more likely that a candidate would be hired, compared to a similarly-qualified candidate without that certification. Interestingly, the study also found that — despite the chronic problems created by the cybersecurity industry’s ongoing skills gap — employers have an even stronger preference for candidates with bachelor’s degrees related to the field. “There’s a global shift in mindset about certification and training being an acceptable substitute for a university degree,” said Gallup’s Rohit Kar, who noted that a growing number of employers “are open to the idea of choosing employees based on their certification or training that they got outside of the university degree.” The recent State of Cybersecurity 2022 report from ISACA — whose Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) certification is widely held and valued — corroborated these findings, with 88 percent of respondents saying that a job applicant’s credentials are important and "

Women held 25 percent of cybersecurity jobs globally in 2022, up from 20 percent in 2019 and around 10 percent in 2013. Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that women will represent 30 percent of the global cybersecurity workforce by 2025, increasing to 35 percent by 2031. As cyber threats escalate worldwide, government agencies and the enterprise alike are fighting to recruit enough talent to defend against today’s cybercriminals. Threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are constantly evolving and the odds are often stacked against organizations lacking enough in-house assistance. Consequently, cybercrime is predicted to inflict damages reaching $8 trillion USD globally this year, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. Cybercrime doesn’t just impact us on an individual level. Companies, whether SMBs or Fortune 500s, must handle threats ranging from phishing, Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams, ransomware, zero-day exploitation, cyberespionage, and even, in select cases, the behemoths of cybercrime: nation-state-sponsored groups. Our data and assets need protection. But everyone is facing the same problem: a lack of diversity and talent in the cybersecurity industry. There are millions of unfulfilled cybersecurity roles worldwide, a scarcity predicted to persist for years to come. To compound the challenge, our current, skilled teams are under tremendous pressure, increasing the risk of burnout. Such strain has led some — particularly security leaders — to opt for short tenures before changing roles, or leaving the industry entirely. The solution is right in front of us. By becoming more "

PHOTO: Cybercrime Magazine. 07 Oct Backstory Of The World’s First Chief Information Security Officer Posted at 11:27h in Blogs by Cybercrime Magazine Steve Katz pioneered the CISO position Sponsored by King & Union – Steve Morgan, Editor-in-Chief Northport, N.Y. – Oct. 13, 2020 The chief information security officer (CISO) role dates back to 1994, when financial services giant Citigroup (then Citicorp, ranked 17th on the Fortune 500 at the time) set up a specialized cybersecurity office after suffering a series of cyberattacks from Russian hackers. Steve Katz was anointed CISO. “I was running information security at JPMorgan at the time, and the rumor on Wall Street was that Citicorp had been hacked,” recalls Katz, who recently visited Cybercrime Magazine’s production studio in Northport, N.Y., a few miles from his home on Long Island. “You know we had the hack so you have a blank check to set up anything you want,” Katz was told by his new bosses, who were tapped by the CEO and board at Citicorp to shore up their digital defenses. “We want to make sure it doesn’t happen again. We want you to build the best information security department anywhere on the globe.” Katz learned a shocking detail after he signed on for the new gig. “They were going to announce the hack a month after I got started.” Talk about being thrown under the bus. “Your reputation is over,” exclaimed Katz’ wife, after the Citicorp hack was announced to the media. Major newspapers and broadcast TV couldn’t help but mention the name of the big bank’s new CISO. “I got into the office that day and my phone didn’t stop ringing. Yea, Katz, you just killed your career,” the first-ever CISO remembers vividly. Cybercrime TV: Steve Katz, The World’s First CISO A cybersecurity history lesson Katz’ six-year tenure as Citicorp’s CISO from 1995 to 2001, and his involvement in the cybersecurity community afterwards, is chronicled in a new short film produced by Cybersecurity Ventures, and spons"

Kevin Mitnick, the world’s most famous hacker, suddenly appears in our East Coast studios on Oct. 19, 2019, a Saturday afternoon, at 4:38 p.m. It’s a brisk sunny day and Mitnick’s hair is windswept from the breeze off Northport Harbor. He’s decked out in black from head to toe — glasses, t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers. We stare. He’s a little rumpled and jet-lagged after a twelve-hour flight from Australia, and his assistant offers up a neatly pressed black button-down shirt. We say hello, and supply a hairbrush. “Where can I buy a Red Bull?” asks the iconic cyber star. Five minutes later, we conjure up a can. Cybercrime TV: Best of Kevin Mitnick His favorite hack ever, age 16, at a McDonald’s drive-thru Mitnick heads to the dressing room — if our restroom qualifies for such a distinction — and he emerges moments later looking like a magician ready to perform on the Las Vegas strip. He does, after all, live nearby. And make no doubt about it, the man has got some serious tricks up his sleeve. He gulps the energy drink over some small talk while our cameraman sets up across the hall. We muster up the confidence to ask a few questions about his background — to test the waters of where we might go with him. Mitnick’s affable demeanor puts us at ease. Whatever misconceptions we had about the former fugitive are instantly laid to rest.

PHOTO: Cybercrime Magazine. 03 Feb Steve Wozniak Phreaks Out On The History Of Hacking Posted at 16:40h in Blogs, Videos by Cybercrime Magazine Apple’s co-founder takes us to back to 1971 – Steve Morgan, Editor-in-Chief Sausalito, Calif. – Feb. 4, 2022 Steve Wozniak aka “The Woz” learned about phreaking from the 1971 Esquire article “Secrets of the Little Blue Box” by Ron Rosenbaum. Halfway through the article, Woz called his friend, Steve Jobs, and read it to him. They were fascinated by the exploits of Joybubbles, Captain Crunch, and the underground telephone hackers who were whistling their way into Ma Bell (AT&T), which was the largest company in the world, employing over one million people and controlling almost all U.S. local and long-distance service, as well as the equipment in most homes and networks. Woz and Jobs went on to make history by building a blue box, which was digital and more technologically advanced compared to the electronics analog models being used by phone phreaks at that time. “What a trip that was,” says Woz. “I had tricks in there that I never even equaled in my Apple designs, believe it or not.” Cybercrime Radio: The Woz Gives Us A History Lesson The Digital Blue Box Watching Woz give demos of the illegal product in the Berkeley dorms (where Woz was a student), Jobs had the idea that they should be selling the blue boxes — for $150 each. Some students bought as many as 10 and 20 blue boxes at a time. Woz never knew what someone would do with so many units — but he says they did wind up in the hands of some celebrities. Contrary to various media, the police did not shut down the blue box business, and Woz and Jobs never got in trouble for it. “I never really hacked,” says Woz, referring to malicious activity that typifies cybercrime. “We were doing stuff for fun.” We asked Woz if the phreaking and blue box experience was the best time of his life, and if Jobs were still alive would he want to talk about it. “As he (Jobs) got ne"

Although the numbers listed below have been featured and quoted (with attribution to us as the source) by hundreds of major media outlets, vendors, academia, governments, associations, event producers, and industry experts — the material is all original research which first appeared in reports published by Cybersecurity Ventures. 1. Global cybercrime damage predicted to hit $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. If it were measured as a country, then cybercrime — which is predicted to inflict damages totaling $9.5 trillion USD globally in 2024 — would be the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China. Cybersecurity Ventures expects global cybercrime costs to grow by 15 percent over the next year, reaching $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion USD in 2015. This represents the greatest transfer of economic wealth in history, risks the incentives for innovation and investment, is exponentially larger than the damage inflicted from natural disasters in a year, and will be more profitable than the global trade of all major illegal drugs combined. Cybercrime costs include damage and destruction of data, stolen money, lost productivity, theft of intellectual property, theft of personal and financial data, embezzlement, fraud, post-attack disruption to the normal course of business, forensic investigation, restoration and deletion of hacked data and systems, and reputational harm. 2. Global cybersecurity spending will exceed $1.75 trillion cumulatively from 2021-2025.

        "raw_content": "The Hacker News Mar 24, 2025 Despite the widespread adoption of DDoS protection solutions, disruptive DDoS attacks continue to make headlines. Why? Even \"basic\" attacks are bypassing established defenses, as evidenced by the recent DDoS attack on X. Our analysis, based on over 100,000 hours of annual attack simulations, reveals that all deployed DDoS protections are highly vulnerable — gaps that often go unnoticed until an attack successfully disrupts services. With no effective way to address these weaknesses preemptively, organizations remain exposed. This article examines why DDoS attacks persist and continue to inflict significant damage. How Even Simple Attacks Bring Down the Best DDoS Protections In 2024, Cloudflare reported more than 25 million DDoS attacks - representing a 53% YoY increase. This growing number of DDoS attacks and their escalating cost from damage begs the question: What are we missing? And how can the risk of these attacks (and the damage they cause) be reduced? Unlike other types of cyberattacks, the only way a DDoS attack can succeed in damaging online service availability is by exploiting vulnerabilities in the deployed DDoS protections - i.e., the only way you can have a damaging DDoS attack (once you have protections) is due to DDoS vulnerabilities in DDoS protection security policies. Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS Advanced Shield, etc. don't go down when a damaging attack occurs. It's the end customer's organization that does. Closing Holes that Attackers Love to Exploit To illustrate the importance of eliminating DDoS vulnerabilities, let's evaluate how DDoS vulnerabilities compare to other types of vulnerabilities. Take, for example, the case of vulnerabilities in Web applications: From a theoretical perspective, there would be no need to deploy a WAF if your Web application were to be continuously validated pre-and post-deployment, and if you followed an ongoing process of checking for vulnerabilities that included: Undergoing strict stat"

        "raw_content": "The Hacker News Mar 31, 2025 It's been reported that a new, generative AI worm dubbed \"Morris II\" has emerged. And for many, this new, generative AI worm is an understandable reason to panic. Pushing back against hysteria, however, we discover that Morris II only targets AI apps and AI-enabled email assistants. No attack is a good one, but at least this one's very specific. More importantly, the recognition that just as AI is helping to accelerate and automate attacks, it will also drastically improve security efficacy. While AI threatens to overwhelm reactive security teams with the pace and sophistication of its onslaught, it can likewise enable proactive prevention through predictive processes and controls. This is critical to giving security teams the chance to withstand the barrage that awaits them. Scaling alongside AI-enabled attacks There are two proactive efforts that scale well when accelerated attacks become the norm. Neither of these efforts need to be AI-powered to be effective against AI-based attacks, but AI can certainly enhance both of them. I believe not having these techniques in place will almost guarantee security teams will fail to keep up with AI-enabled attacks. The first is zero trust. Zero trust is not a single product or solution – it is a paradigm for architecting infrastructure. Individually authenticating each access request is a good starting place. A core tenet of zero trust entails eliminating the assumption (i.e. \"implicit trust\") that a user on the inside is already authenticated and authorized to use a resource. Crucially, zero trust is capable of scaling in the face of accelerated attacks. Many organizations benefit from zero trust's tendency to automatically contain attacks. This reduces the blast radius of any successful intrusion and can even foil attackers' reconnaissance efforts. Isolating users and assets with techniques such as microsegmentation prevents attacks from spreading. However, complete network microsegmentation c"

        "raw_content": "Apr 01, 2025Ravie LakshmananNetwork Security / Vulnerability Cybersecurity researchers are warning of a spike in suspicious login scanning activity targeting Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS GlobalProtect gateways, with nearly 24,000 unique IP addresses attempting to access these portals. \"This pattern suggests a coordinated effort to probe network defenses and identify exposed or vulnerable systems, potentially as a precursor to targeted exploitation,\" threat intelligence firm GreyNoise said. The surge is said to have commenced on March 17, 2025, sustaining at nearly 20,000 unique IP addresses per day before dropping off on March 26. At its peak, 23,958 unique IP addresses are estimated to have participated in the activity. Of these, only a smaller subset of 154 IP addresses has been flagged as malicious. The United States and Canada have emerged as the top sources of traffic, followed by Finland, the Netherlands, and Russia. The activity has primarily targeted systems in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Russia, and Singapore. It's currently not clear what's driving the activity, but it points to a systemic approach to testing network defenses, which could likely pave the way for later exploitation. \"Over the past 18 to 24 months, we've observed a consistent pattern of deliberate targeting of older vulnerabilities or well-worn attack and reconnaissance attempts against specific technologies,\" Bob Rudis, VP of Data Science at GreyNoise, said. \"These patterns often coincide with new vulnerabilities emerging 2 to 4 weeks later.\" In light of the unusual activity, it's imperative that organizations with internet-facing Palo Alto Networks instances take steps to secure their login portals. When reached for comment, Palo Alto Networks told The Hacker News that it's actively tracking the situation, urging customers to take steps to ensure that their instances are running the latest version of the software. \"The security of our customers is always our top priority"

Resecurity said it identified a security vulnerability in the data leak site (DLS) operated by the e-crime group that made it possible to extract configuration files, credentials, as well as the history of commands executed on the server. The flaw concerns a \"certain misconfiguration in the Data Leak Site (DLS) of BlackLock Ransomware, leading to clearnet IP addresses disclosure related to their network infrastructure behind TOR hidden services (hosting them) and additional service information,\" the company said. It described the acquired history of commands as one of the biggest operational security (OPSEC) failures of BlackLock ransomware. BlackLock is a rebranded version of another ransomware group known as Eldorado. It has since become one of the most active extortion syndicates in 2025, heavily targeting technology, manufacturing, construction, finance, and retail sectors. As of last month, it has listed 46 victims on its site. The impacted organizations are located in Argentina, Aruba, Brazil, Canada, Congo, Croatia, Peru, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The group, which announced the launch of an underground affiliate network in mid-January 2025, has also been observed actively recruiting traffers to facilitate early stages of the attacks by directing victims to malicious pages that deploy malware capable of establishing initial access to compromised systems. The vulnerability identified by Resecurity is a local file inclusion (LFI) bug, essentially tricking the web server into leaking sensitive information by performing a path traversal attack, including the history of commands executed by t"

From phishing schemes to zero-click exploits, malicious Office files are still one of the easiest ways into a victim's system. Here are the top three Microsoft Office-based exploits still making the rounds this year and what you need to know to avoid them. 1. Phishing in MS Office: Still Hackers' Favorite Phishing attacks using Microsoft Office files have been around for years, and they're still going strong. Why? Because they work, especially in business environments where teams constantly exchange Word and Excel documents. Attackers know that people are used to opening Office files, especially if they come from what looks like a colleague, a client, or a partner. A fake invoice, a shared report, or a job offer: it doesn't take much to convince someone to click. And once the file is open, the attacker has their chance. Phishing with Office files often aims to steal login credentials. These documents might include: Links to fake Microsoft 365 login pages Phishing portals that mimic company tools or services Redirect chains that eventually land on credential-harvesting sites In this ANY.RUN malware analysis session, an Excel file contains malicious phishing link: View analysis session with Excel file Excel file containing malicious link detected inside ANY.RUN sandbox When clicked, the victim is taken to a webpage that shows a Cloudflare \"Verify you're a human\" check. CloudFlare verification passed with ANY.RUN's automated interactivity After clicking through, there's another redirect; this time to a fake Microsoft login page. Malicious link to fake Microsoft login page with random characters At first glance, it might look real. But inside the ANY.RUN sandbox, it's easy to spot red flags.

In a 2024 study, 49% of 644 respondents who frequently used Microsoft 365 believed that they had less than 10 apps connected to the platform, despite the fact that aggregated data indicated over 1,000+ Microsoft 365 SaaS-to-SaaS connections on average per deployment. And that's just one major SaaS provider. Imagine other unforeseen critical security risks: Each SaaS app has unique security configurations—making misconfigurations a top risk. Business-critical apps (CRM, finance, and collaboration tools) store vast amounts of sensitive data, making them prime targets for attackers. Shadow IT and third-party integrations introduce hidden vulnerabilities that often go unnoticed. Large and small third-party AI service providers (e.g. audio/video transcription service) may not comply with legal and regulatory requirements, or properly test and review code. Major SaaS providers also have thousands of developers pushing changes every day. Understanding each SaaS app, assessing risks, and securing configurations is overwhelming and inhumanly possible. And much of it is just noise. Perhaps nothing malicious is going on at scale, but small details can often be overlooked. Traditional security approaches simply cannot scale to meet these demands, leaving organizations exposed to potential breaches. AI: The Only Way to Keep Up The complexity of SaaS security is outpacing the resources and effort needed to secure it. AI is no longer optional, it's essential. AI-driven security solutions like AskOmni by AppOmni—which combine Generative AI (or GenAI) and advanced analytics—are transforming SaaS security by: ✓ Delivering instant security insights through conversational AI. ✓ Investigating security events efficiently. ✓ Turning complex SaaS security questions into clear, actionable answers. ✓ Visualizing risks for deeper understan"

Why? Their widespread use, configuration complexity, and visibility to attackers as well as users make them more likely to be exploited. This highlights how important your SSL configurations are in maintaining your web application security and minimizing your attack surface. However, research shows that most (53.5%) websites have inadequate security and that weak SSL/TLS configuration is amongst the most common application vulnerabilities. Get your SSL configuration right, and you'll enhance your cyber resilience and keep your apps and data safe. Get it wrong, however, and you can increase your organization's attack surface, exposing your business to more cyberattacks. We'll explore the impacts of SSL misconfigurations and explain why they present such a significant attack surface risk. Then, we'll show you how a s...

And for many, this new, generative AI worm is an understandable reason to panic. Pushing back against hysteria, however, we discover that Morris II only targets AI apps and AI-enabled email assistants. No attack is a good one, but at least this one's very specific. More importantly, the recognition that just as AI is helping to accelerate and automate attacks, it will also drastically improve security efficacy. While AI threatens to overwhelm reactive security teams with the pace and sophistication of its onslaught, it can likewise enable proactive prevention through predictive processes and controls. This is critical to giving security teams the chance to withstand the barrage that awaits them. Scaling alongside AI-enabled attacks There are two proactive efforts that scale well when accelerated attacks become the norm.

Why? Even \"basic\" attacks are bypassing established defenses, as evidenced by the recent DDoS attack on X. Our analysis, based on over 100,000 hours of annual attack simulations, reveals that all deployed DDoS protections are highly vulnerable — gaps that often go unnoticed until an attack successfully disrupts services. With no effective way to address these weaknesses preemptively, organizations remain exposed. This article examines why DDoS attacks persist and continue to inflict significant damage.

Outlaw is also the name given to the threat actors behind the malware. It's believed to be of Romanian origin. Other hacking groups dominating the cryptojacking landscape include 8220, Keksec (aka Kek Security), Kinsing, and TeamTNT. Active since at least late 2018, the hacking crew has brute-forced SSH servers, abusing the foothold to conduct reconnaissance and maintain persistence on the compromised hosts by adding their own SSH keys to the \"authorized_keys\" file. The attackers are also known to incorporate a multi-stage infection process that involves using a dropper shell script (\"tddwrt7s.sh​\") to download an archive file (\"dota3.tar.gz\"), which is then unpacked to launch the miner while also taking steps to remove traces of past compromises and kill both the competition and their own previous miners. A notable feature of the malware is an initial access component (aka BLITZ) that allows for self-propagation of the malware in a botnet-like fashion by scanning for vulnerable systems running an SSH service. The brute-force module is configured to fetch a target list from an SSH command-and-control (C2) server to further perpetuate the cycle. Some iterations of the attacks have also resorted to exploiting Linux- and Unix-based operating systems susceptible to CVE-2016-8655 and CVE-2016-5195 (aka Dirty COW), as well as attack systems with weak Telnet credentials. Upon gaining initial access, the malware deploys SHELLBOT for remote control via a C2 server using an IRC channel. SHELLBOT, for its part, enables the"

Organizations often assume that firewalls, endpoint protection, and SIEMs are enough to keep them secure. But how effective are these defenses when put to the test? That's where vPenTest, Vonahi Security's automated network pentesting platform, comes in. Designed to simulate real-world attack scenarios, vPenTest helps organizations find exploitable vulnerabilities before cybercriminals can. These aren't complex, zero-day exploits. They're misconfigurations, weak passwords, and unpatched vulnerabilities that attackers routinely exploit to gain access, move laterally, and escalate privileges within networks. Here's how these risks break down: 50% stem from misconfigurations – Default settings, weak access controls, and overlooked security policies. 30% are due to missing patches – Unpatched systems that leave the door open for known exploits. 20% involve weak passwords – Services running without proper authentication, making it easy for attackers to get in. In this article, we'll cover the ten most critical internal network security risks, breaking down what they are, why they're dangerous, and how to fix them before they turn into real problems. We'll start with the least common and work our way up to the number one issue we've seen across thousands of assessments with vPenTest. If these weaknesses exist in your environment, attackers will find them—it's just a matter of time. 10.

This wasn't Blue's first day and despite his solid defense in front of the mirror, he feels the pressure. But something changed in the ring; the variety of punches, the feints, the intensity – it's nothing like his coach's simulations. Is my defense strong enough to withstand this? He wonders, do I even have a defense? His coach reassures him \"If it weren't for all your practice, you wouldn't have defended those first jabs. You've got a defense—now you need to calibrate it. And that happens in the ring.\" Cybersecurity is no different. You can have your hands up—deploying the right architecture, policies, and security measures—but the smallest gap in your defense could let an attacker land a knockout punch. The only way to test your readiness is under pressure, sparring in the ring. The Difference Between Practice and the Real Fight In boxing, sparring partners are abundant. Every day, fighters step into the ring to hone their skills against real opponents. But in cybersecurity, sparring partners are more sparse. The equivalent is penetration testing, but a pentest happens at a typical organization only once a year, maybe twice, at best every quarter. It requires extensive preparation, contracting an expensive specialist agency, and cordoning off the environment to be tested.

As many as 49 merchants are estimated to have been affected by the campaign to date. Fifteen of the compromised sites have taken action to remove the malicious script injections. The activity is assessed to be ongoing since at least August 20, 2024. Details of the campaign were first flagged by security firm Source Defense towards the end of February 2025, detailing the web skimmer's use of the \"api.stripe[.]com/v1/sources\" API, which allows applications to accept various payment methods. The endpoint has since been deprecated in favor of the new PaymentMethods API. The attack chains employ malicious domains as the initial distribution point for the JavaScript skimmer that's designed to intercept and hide the legitimate payment form on order checkout pages, serve a replica of the legitimate Stripe payment screen, validate it using the sources API, and then transmit it to a remote server in Base64-encoded format. Jscrambler said the threat actors behind the operation are likely leveraging vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in WooCommerce, WordPress, and PrestaShop to implant the initial stage script. This loader script serves to decipher and launch a Base64-encoded next-stage, which, in turn, contains the URL pointing to the skimmer. \"The skimming script hides the legitimate Stripe iframe and overlays it with a malicious one designed to mimic its appearance,\" the researchers said. \"It also clones the 'Place Order' button, hiding the real one.\" Once the "

The security shortcoming has been codenamed ImageRunner by the cybersecurity company. Following responsible disclosure, Google addressed the problem as of January 28, 2025. Google Cloud Run is a fully managed service for executing containerized applications in a scalable, serverless environment. When the technology is used to run a service, container images are retrieved from the Artifact Registry (or Docker Hub) for subsequent deployment by specifying the image URL. At issue is the fact that there are certain identities that lack container registry permissions but that have edit permissions on Google Cloud Run revisions. Each time a Cloud Run service is deployed or updated, a new version is created. And each time a Cloud Run revision is deployed, a service agent account is used to pull the necessary images. \"If an attacker gains certain permissions within a victim's project -- specifically run.services.update and iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permissions -- they could modify a Cloud Run service and deploy a new revision,\" Matan explained. \"In doing so, they could specify any private container image within the same project for the service to pull.\" What's more, the attacker could access sensitive or proprietary images stored in a victim's registries and even introduce malicious instructions that, when executed, could be abused to extract secrets, exfiltrate sensitive data, "

The infections were recorded between March 13 and 27, 2025. Triada is the name given to a modular Android malware family that was first discovered by the Russian cybersecurity company in March 2016. A remote access trojan (RAT), it's equipped to steal a wide range of sensitive information, as well as enlist infected devices into a botnet for other malicious activities. While the malware was previously observed being distributed via intermediate apps published on the Google Play Store (and elsewhere) that gained root access to the compromised phones, subsequent campaigns have leveraged WhatsApp mods like FMWhatsApp and YoWhatsApp as a propagation vector. Over the years, altered versions of Triada have also found their way into off-brand Android tablets, TV boxes, and digital projectors as part of a widespread fraud scheme called BADBOX that has leveraged hardware supply chain compromises and third-party marketplaces for initial access. This behavior was first observed in 2017, when the malware evolved to a pre-installed Android framework backdoor, allowing the threat actors to remotely control the devices, inject more malware, and exploit them for various illicit activities. \"Triada infects device system images through a third-party during the production process,\" Google noted in June 2019. \"Sometimes OEMs want to include features that aren't part of the Android Open Source Project, such as face unlock.

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-10668 (CVSS score: 5.9), is a bypass for two of the 10 shortcomings that were originally disclosed by SafeBreach Labs in August 2024 under the name QuickShell. It has been addressed in Quick Share for Windows version 1.0.2002.2 following responsible disclosure in August 2024. A consequence of these 10 vulnerabilities, collectively tracked as CVE-2024-38271 (CVSS score: 5.9) and CVE-2024-38272 (CVSS score: 7.1), was that they could have been fashioned into an exploit chain to obtain arbitrary code execution on Windows hosts. Quick Share (previously Nearby Share) is a peer-to-peer file-sharing utility similar to Apple AirDrop that allows users to transfer files, photos, videos, and other documents between Android devices, Chromebooks, and Windows desktops and laptops in close physical proximity. A follow-up analysis by the cybersecurity company found that two of the vulnerabilities were not fixed correctly, once again causing the application to crash or bypass the need for a recipient to accept a file transfer request by directly transmitting a file to the device instead. Specifically, the DoS bug could be triggered by using a file name that starts with a different invalid UTF8 continuation byte (e.g., \"\\xc5\\xff\") instead of a file name that begins with a NULL terminator (\"\\x00\"). On the other hand, the initial fix for the unauthorized file write vulnerability marked such transferred files as \"unknown\" and deleted them from the disk after the file transfer session was complete. This, SafeBreach researcher Or Yair said, could be circumvented by sending two different files in the same session with the same \"payload ID,\" "

Yet, despite its potential, implementation often stalls behind a wall of security, legal, and compliance hurdles. Imagine this all-too-familiar scenario: A CISO wants to deploy an AI-driven SOC to handle the overwhelming volume of security alerts and potential attacks. Before the project can begin, it must pass through layers of GRC (governance, risk, and compliance) approval, legal reviews, and funding hurdles. This gridlock delays innovation, leaving organizations without the benefits of an AI-powered SOC while cybercriminals keep advancing. Let's break down why AI adoption faces such resistance, distinguish genuine risks from bureaucratic obstacles, and explore practical collaboration strategies between vendors, C-suite, and GRC teams. We'll also provide tips from CISOs who have dealt with these issues extensively as well as a cheat sheet of questions AI vendors must answer to satisfy enterprise gatekeepers. Compliance as the primary barrier to AI adoption Security and compliance concerns consistently top the list of reasons why enterprises hesitate to invest in AI. Industry leaders like Cloudera and AWS have documented this trend across sectors, revealing a pattern of innovation paralysis driven by regulatory uncertainty. When you dig deeper into why AI compliance creates such roadblocks, three interconnected challenges emerge. First, regulatory uncertainty keeps shifting the goalposts for your compliance teams. Consider how your European operations might have just adapted to GDPR requirements, only to face entirely new AI Act provisions with different risk categories and compliance benchmarks. If your organization is international, this puzzle of regional AI legislation and policies only becomes more complex. In addition, framework inconsistenci"

        "raw_content": "The Hacker News Mar 10, 2025 SaaS applications are the backbone of modern organizations, powering productivity and collaboration. However, they also introduce critical security risks—identity sprawl, misconfigurations, and an expanding attack surface. Identity providers have become a prime target for threat actors, prompting security teams to focus on protecting identities across multiple SaaS environments. To mitigate these risks, many organizations adopt SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) to harden configurations, enforce least-privilege access, and maintain visibility over human and non-human identities. SSPM is an essential preventive tool that improves cyber hygiene by reducing the attack surface. Yet prevention alone is not enough in today's evolving threat landscape. Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) is crucial to bridge this gap and enable organizations to detect and respond fast to active threats targeting their identity infrastructure. The Growing Threat to SaaS Identities The rise in identity-based attacks highlights the inherent weaknesses of traditional security measures. Exploitable misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and credential misuse remain key attack vectors. Stolen credentials and privileged access account for 61% of all data breaches. ​Attackers circumvent preventive measures by exploiting identity providers, OAuth tokens, and privileged accounts across various SaaS applications. A notable instance from 2024 is the breach involving Microsoft's internal systems by the Russian state-sponsored group known as Midnight Blizzard. The attackers initially gained access through a password spray attack targeting a legacy, non-production test tenant account that did not have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled. Subsequently, they exploited a deprecated OAuth application with elevated permissions, allowing them to infiltrate Microsoft's Office 365 environment and access internal email correspondences of senior executives.

A notable aspect of the campaign is that it primarily targets centralized finance entities by impersonating companies like Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, Circle, Securitize, BlockFi, Tether, Robinhood, and Bybit, marking a departure from the hacking group's attacks against decentralized finance (DeFi) entities. Contagious Interview, like Operation Dream Job, employs fake job offers as lures to attract prospective targets and dupe them into downloading malware that can steal cryptocurrency and other sensitive data. As part of the effort, candidates are approached via LinkedIn or X to prepare for a video call interview, for which they are asked to download a malware-laced videoconferencing software or open-source project that activates the infection process. Lazarus Group's use of the ClickFix tactic was first disclosed towards the end of 2024 by security researcher Taylor Monahan, with the attack chains leading to the "

Why? Their widespread use, configuration complexity, and visibility to attackers as well as users make them more likely to be exploited. This highlights how important your SSL configurations are in maintaining your web application security and minimizing your attack surface. However, research shows that most (53.5%) websites have inadequate security and that weak SSL/TLS configuration is amongst the most common application vulnerabilities. Get your SSL configuration right, and you'll enhance your cyber resilience and keep your apps and data safe. Get it wrong, however, and you can increase your organization's attack surface, exposing your business to more cyberattacks. We'll explore the impacts of SSL misconfigurations and explain why they present such a significant attack surface risk. Then, we'll show you how a s...

        "raw_content": "Conventional wisdom says one reason so many hackers seem to hail from Russia and parts of the former Soviet Union is that these countries have traditionally placed a much greater emphasis than educational institutions in the West on teaching information technology in middle and high schools, and yet they lack a Silicon Valley-like pipeline to help talented IT experts channel their skills into high-paying jobs. This post explores the first part of that assumption by examining a breadth of open-source data. The supply side of that conventional wisdom seems to be supported by an analysis of educational data from both the U.S. and Russia, which indicates there are several stark and important differences between how American students are taught and tested on IT subjects versus their counterparts in Eastern Europe. Compared to the United States there are quite a few more high school students in Russia who choose to specialize in information technology subjects. One way to measure this is to look at the number of high school students in the two countries who opt to take the advanced placement exam for computer science. According to an analysis (PDF) by The College Board, in the ten years between 2005 and 2016 a total of 270,000 high school students in the United States opted to take the national exam in computer science (the “Computer Science Advanced Placement” exam). Compare that to the numbers from Russia: A 2014 study (PDF) on computer science (called “Informatics” in Russia) by the Perm State National Research University found that roughly 60,000 Russian students register each year to take their nation’s equivalent to the AP exam — known as the “Unified National Examination.” Extrapolating that annual 60,000 number over ten years suggests that more than twice as many people in Russia — 600,000 — have taken the computer science exam at the high school level over the past decade.

Andriy Onufriyenko, Getty Images Governments should prioritize the use of privacy-boosting technologies like encryption, de-identification and hashing to prevent breaches and data misuse, a report that New America’s Open Technology Institute published Tuesday recommends. The study comes as cyber and privacy experts warn about the dangers of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessing sensitive information at federal agencies, also the subject of numerous court challenges. Last week, an executive order on information sharing across the federal bureaucracy also raised alarms about civil liberties risks. So-called “privacy enhancing technologies,” or PETs, could safeguard against unauthorized access like DOGE’s, said the report’s author, Sydney Saubestre. “Data sharing is really important, but obviously so is privacy,” she said. “They’re equally important and they’re equally critical, and they shouldn’t necessarily be in opposition to each other. One of the ways that you can remove some of the risk around data sharing is to make sure that you have a privacy-first approach to data sharing, and PETs are a really great way to accomplish that.” Advertisement googletag.cmd.push(function() ); PETs include more commonly known terms like encryption, but also lesser-known tech like synthetic data, which is computer-generated information that reflects properties of real-world data but doesn’t contain any authentic personal information.

Registered voters in Pennsylvania can vote \"On Demand\" by requesting, a mail-in or absentee ballot filing it out and dropping it off all in one visit to their county election office or other designated location. (Photo by Hannah Beier/Getty Images) President Donald Trump issued an executive order Tuesday that threatens states with the loss of federal election grants unless they comply with a broad list of requirements concerning the administration of elections. The order makes numerous inaccurate and misleading claims about American elections, many of which mirror older allegations that Trump made regularly on the campaign trail. Those include claims that voter rolls are riddled with non-citizens registered to vote in federal elections, something that state and local election officials, experts, courts and numerous post-election audits have repeatedly debunked. The order would put federal agencies — including the Election Assistance Commission, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice — in charge of vetting and verifying state claims around proof of citizenship and non-citizen voting. The order specifically directs the EAC to update federal voting forms to require “documentary proof” of citizenship. This includes a U.S. passport, REAL IDs, military IDs, and any federal or state identification that explicitly affirms U.S. citizenship. The order then directs the EAC — an independent agency e"

Both Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe apologized during a House Intelligence Committee hearing Wednesday, yet continued to claim that no sources, methods, locations or war plans were shared in the chat. “This was a standard update to the national security Cabinet that was provided alongside updates that were given to foreign partners in the region,” Gabbard said. “Ideally, these conversations occur in person. However, at times, fast-moving coordination of an unclassified nature is necessary where in-person conversation is not an option.” The controversy consumed what was initially expected to be a routine hearing addressing worldwide threats.

By Matt Kapko March 27, 2025 Listen to this article 0:00 Learn more. This feature uses an automated voice, which may result in occasional errors in pronunciation, tone, or sentiment. (Stephen Shankland / Flickr) Sometimes the simplest pieces of software can cause the most complex security headaches for organizations. Browser extensions, which can be bought, sold and repurposed without warning, are a blind spot for organizations — ignored and often left unrecognized as a hidden threat. John Tuckner, founder of the browser extension security company Secure Annex, recently demonstrated how quickly he bought and repurposed an extension to redirect traffic. For this experiment, Tuckner found and purchased an extension named “Website Blocker” for $50 and transferred ownership to himself in the Chrome Web Store for a $5 fee. His experience underscores how difficult — “absolutely impossible,” he said — it is for browser extension users to know when ownership changes hands or extensions they use are repurposed for potentially malicious intent. Advertisement googletag.cmd.push(function() ); “A Chrome Web Store extension listing can say one thing, but once you install it, what’s actually in the code and what’s in the package that you install, that gets really tricky,” Tuckner said in an interview. “There’s a lot of gray area to declare if something is malicious or not.” Once Tuckner gained ownership of the extension, he submitted an update to the Chrome Web Store and, hours later, pushed new code to the user base. “Browser extension updates, by default, occur automatically and silently when a user’s browser detects a new version available in the Chrome Web Store,” he wrote in a blog post. “Only if new permissions are requested by the e"

The executive order, issued last week, is entitled “Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness.” Its stated purpose is to improve defenses against cyberattacks and other risks, but many expect it will do the opposite. “Federal policy must rightly recognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the State, local, and even individual levels, supported by a competent, accessible, and efficient Federal Government,” it reads. “Citizens are the immediate beneficiaries of sound local decisions and investments designed to address risks, including cyber attacks, wildfires, hurricanes, and space weather.” A number of cyber experts said it was a misguided document, sometimes in harsh terms, especially as it pertains to where they believe responsibilities should be assigned.

Andriy Onufriyenko, via Getty Images More than 40% of cloud environments are at risk of an account takeover due to a series of five recently discovered vulnerabilities — one regarded critical — in the Ingress Nginx Controller for Kubernetes, according to security research published this week. Upon discovering the string of vulnerabilities in one of most widely used ingress controllers for Kubernetes, Wiz researchers described the potential risk as an “IngressNightmare” in a blog post Monday. The most serious defect, an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-1974, has a CVSS score of 9.8. Security researchers told CyberScoop they aren’t aware of any active exploitation, but the risk for publicly exposed and unpatched Ingress Nginx controllers is extremely high. “The exploit chain is unauthenticated and a target is vulnerable in a default configuration,” Stephen Fewer, principal security researcher at Rapid7, said in an email. “With exploit code for CVE-2025-1974 starting to be published online, Kubernetes administrators should remediate publicly-exposed instances on an urgent basis.” Advertisement googletag.cmd.push(function() ); Ingress Nginx maintainers released patches for CVE-2025-1097, CVE-2025-1098, CVE-2025-1974, CVE-2025-24513 and CVE-2025-24514 on Monday.

Source: Getty Images Cybercriminals predominantly relied on weaknesses in identity controls to afflict organizations in 2024, with valid accounts being the main way they gained access for the second year in a row, Cisco Talos said in an annual report released Monday. Across the incident response cases Cisco Talos responded to last year, 60% involved an identity attack component, researchers said. Attackers used legitimate credentials, session cookies and API keys to gain access, achieve lateral movement and escalate privileges on compromised environments. Identity is a recurring problem for enterprises, reflecting a widespread deficiency attackers have identified in business infrastructure and targeted at scale with great success. This method of intrusion triggers malicious follow-on activities with attackers confronting minimal resistance or detection because the traffic originates from presumably legitimate accounts. Identity attacks were ubiquitous in the incidents Cisco Talos responded to last year, but the harm dealt to organizations was especially pronounced in ransomware attacks. Half of all identity-based attacks Cisco Talos responded to last year were ultimately executed for ransomware or pre-ransomware operations.

Among the Trump administration’s stated goals for the sanctions are restricting the Chinese government from acquiring high-performance and exascale computing capabilities to build AI systems and quantum computers for military use. “We will not allow adversaries to exploit American technology to bolster their own militaries and threaten American lives,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. “We are committed to using every tool at the Department’s disposal to ensure our most advanced technologies stay out of the hands of those who seek to harm Americans.” Advertisement googletag.cmd.push(function() ); The newly added Chinese entities include the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence and Beijing Innovation Wisdom Technology, for acquiring or attempting to acquire U.S. products for AI models, as well as advanced computing chips.

Trellix simplifies this through its Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution, which can be rolled out quickly. Graziano also addressed the difficulties of managing cybersecurity in hybrid cloud environments, emphasizing Trellix’s unified policy approach. Lastly, he highlighted Trellix Wise, an AI-driven tool that enhances threat-hunting efficiency.

        "raw_content": "Image: Shutterstock. Greg Meland. President Trump last week issued a flurry of executive orders that upended a number of government initiatives focused on improving the nation’s cybersecurity posture. The president fired all advisors from the Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber Safety Review Board, called for the creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, and voided a Biden administration action that sought to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence poses to consumers, workers and national security. On his first full day back in the White House, Trump dismissed all 15 advisory committee members of the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a nonpartisan government entity established in February 2022 with a mandate to investigate the causes of major cybersecurity events. The CSRB has so far produced three detailed reports, including an analysis of the Log4Shell vulnerability crisis, attacks from the cybercrime group LAPSUS$, and the 2023 Microsoft Exchange Online breach. The CSRB was in the midst of an inquiry into cyber intrusions uncovered recently across a broad spectrum of U.S. telecommunications providers at the hands of Chinese state-sponsored hackers. One of the CSRB’s most recognizable names is Chris Krebs (no relation), the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Krebs was fired by President Trump in November 2020 for declaring the presidential contest was the most secure in American history, and for refuting Trump’s false claims of election fraud. South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, confirmed by the U.S. Senate last week as the new director of the DHS, criticized CISA at her confirmation hearing, TheRecord reports. Noem told lawmakers CISA needs to be “much more effective, smaller, more nimble, to really fulfill their mission,” which she said should be focused on hardening federal IT systems and hunting for digital intruders. Noem said the agency’s work on fighting misinformation shows it has “gotten far off "

Cameron John Wagenius, 21, was arrested near the Army base in Fort Cavazos, Texas on Dec. 20, and charged with two criminal counts of unlawful transfer of confidential phone records. Wagenius was a communications specialist at a U.S. Army base in South Korea, who secretly went by the nickname Kiberphant0m and was part of a trio of criminal hackers that extorted dozens of companies last year over stolen data. At the end of 2023, malicious hackers learned that many companies had uploaded sensitive customer records to accounts at the cloud data storage service Snowflake that were protected with little more than a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). After scouring darknet markets for stolen Snowflake account credentials, the hackers began raiding the data storage repositories used by some of the world’s largest corporations. Among those was AT&T, which disclosed in July that cybercriminals had stolen personal information and phone and text message records for roughly 110 million people — nearly all of its customers. AT&T reportedly paid a hacker $370,000 to delete stolen phone records. More than 160 other Snowflake customers were relieved of data, including TicketMaster, Lending Tree, Advance Auto Parts and Neiman Marcus. In several posts to an English-language cybercrime forum in November, Kiberphant0m leaked some of the phone records and threatened to leak them all unless paid a ransom. Prosecutors said that in addition to his public posts on the forum, Wagenius had engaged in multiple direct"

The zero-day seeing exploitation involves CVE-2024-49138, a security weakness in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver — used by applications to write transaction logs — that could let an authenticated attacker gain “system” level privileges on a vulnerable Windows device. The security firm Rapid7 notes there have been a series of zero-day elevation of privilege flaws in CLFS over the past few years. “Ransomware authors who have abused previous CLFS vulnerabilities will be only too pleased to get their hands on a fresh one,” wrote Adam Barnett, lead software engineer at Rapid7. “Expect more CLFS zero-day vulnerabilities to emerge in the future, at least until Microsoft performs a full replacement of the aging CLFS codebase instead of offering spot fixes for specific flaws.” Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities accounted for 29% of the 1,009 security bugs Microsoft has patched so far in 2024, according to a year-end tally by Tenable; nearly 40 percent of those bugs were weaknesses that could let attackers run malicious code on the vulnerable device.

        "raw_content": "In early 2008, while federal investigators were busy investigating disgraced financier Robert Allen Stanford for his part in an alleged $8 billion fraudulent investment scheme, Eastern European hackers were quietly hoovering up tens of thousands customer financial records from the Bank of Antigua, an institution formerly owned by the Stanford Group. According to a fraud investigator with first-hand knowledge of the break-in, the hackers responsible infiltrated a component of the Stanford Group’s network by exploiting vulnerabilities in the company’s Web servers and databases. On the condition of anonymity, the investigator shared with this author files recovered from the breach, which were stored in plain text for at least several weeks on a Web site controlled by the attackers. This source said he forwarded the same information on to the FBI shortly after discovering it in early 2008. Once inside of Stanford’s network, the unidentified hackers appear to have swiped the credentials from an internal network administrator, and soon had downloaded the user names and password hashes for more than 1,000 employees of Stanford Financial, Stanford Group, Stanford Trust, and Stanford International Bank Ltd. Among the purloined files is a listing of what appear to be ownership and balance information for tens of thousands of customer accounts at Bank of Antigua. Each listing includes the account number, owner’s name, address, balance, and accrued interest. Mr. Stanford is set to go on trial this month for allegations that he led a $8 billion fraud scheme. In addition, federal authorities reportedly have been investigating whether Stanford was involved in laundering drug money for Mexico’s notorious Gulf Cartel. Continue reading →"

        "raw_content": "In November 2022, the password manager service LastPass disclosed a breach in which hackers stole password vaults containing both encrypted and plaintext data for more than 25 million users. Since then, a steady trickle of six-figure cryptocurrency heists targeting security-conscious people throughout the tech industry has led some security experts to conclude that crooks likely have succeeded at cracking open some of the stolen LastPass vaults. Taylor Monahan is lead product manager of MetaMask, a popular software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Since late December 2022, Monahan and other researchers have identified a highly reliable set of clues that they say connect recent thefts targeting more than 150 people. Collectively, these individuals have been robbed of more than $35 million worth of crypto. Monahan said virtually all of the victims she has assisted were longtime cryptocurrency investors, and security-minded individuals. Importantly, none appeared to have suffered the sorts of attacks that typically preface a high-dollar crypto heist, such as the compromise of one’s email and/or mobile phone accounts. “The victim profile remains the most striking thing,” Monahan wrote. “They truly all are reasonably secure. They are also deeply integrated into this ecosystem, [including] employees of reputable crypto orgs, VCs [venture capitalists], people who built DeFi protocols, deploy contracts, run full nodes.” Monahan has been documenting the crypto thefts via Twitter/X since March 2023, frequently expressing frustration in the search for a common cause among the victims. Then on Aug. 28, Monahan said she’d concluded that the common thread among nearly every victim was that they’d previously used LastPass to store their “seed phrase,” the private key needed to unlock access to their cryptocurrency investments.

The software contains a feature that checks for new updates on startup (if configured) and can be manually triggered by clicking Help > Software Updates. This will cause the program to connect to the software update server at https://softwareupdate.broadcom.com/cds to check for and download software updates. However, this URL now redirects to Broadcom's generic support page, https://support.broadcom.com/, causing the application to issue certificate validation errors and rendering its built-in update mechanism unusable. \"A certificate error occurred while connecting to the update server. Check your Internet settings or contact your system administrator,\" reads the VMware Workstation error.

It's worth noting that this change has caused frustration among users, as it was implemented without prior notice,\" reads a post to the Broadcom community forums.

        "raw_content": "New Windows 11 trick lets you bypass Microsoft Account requirement By Lawrence Abrams April 1, 2025 05:33 PM 8 A previously unknown trick lets you easily bypass using a Microsoft Account in Windows 11, just as Microsoft tries to make it harder to use local accounts. Since the release of Windows 11, Microsoft has been increasingly closing loopholes and making it harder to use a local account in the operating system. Instead, the company wants you to use a Microsoft Account, as many operating system features rely on cloud-based services. Last week, Microsoft removed the 'BypassNRO.cmd' script from Windows 11 preview builds, which allowed users to bypass the Microsoft Account requirement when installing the operating system. While the Registry commands used by the script still worked, it became less easy to add them, requiring users to type them out or manually edit the Registry. On Saturday, X user \"Wither OrNot\" shared a much easier way to bypass Windows 11's Microsoft Account requirement, which BleepingComputer has confirmed to work. When installing Windows 11 and you reach the screen asking, \"Let's connect you to a network,\" you can use the Shift+F10 keyboard combination to open a Windows command prompt. At this prompt, type start ms-cxh:localonly and press Enter on your keyboard to open a \"Microsoft account\" window where you can create a new local user for the Windows 11 install. Entering the \"start ms-cxh:localonly\" command to create a local accountSource: BleepingComputer After filling in the information and clicking the Next button, the Windows 11 setup will continue. However, now it will continue using your created local account and will not prompt you to use a Microsoft Account. When done installing, you can confirm a local account is being used by clicking on the Start button and then clicking on your account name, as shown below. Windows 11 configured to use a local accountSource: BleepingComputer As you can see, this command makes it much easier to use a l"

According to GreyNoise, which reports the activity, the scanning activity involves over 24,000 unique source IP addresses. The activity peaked at 20,000 unique IP addresses per day on March 17, 2025, and continued at this scale until March 26. Of those IPs, 23,800 are classified as \"suspicious,\" while 154 were validated by the threat monitoring firm as \"malicious,\" leaving little doubt about the activity's true intentions. Most of the scanning attempts originate from the United States and Canada. Most targeted systems are based in the United States, though other countries are targeted too. Observed scanning activitySource: GreyNoise GreyNoise noted that in the past, such spikes in network scanning have been linked to preparatory reconnaissance, which was eventually followed by the disclosure of flaws two to four weeks later. \"Over the past 18 to 24 months, we've observed a consistent pattern of deliberate targeting of older vulnerabilities or well-worn attack and reconnaissance attempts against specific technologies,\" states Bob Rudis, VP of Data Science at GreyNoise. \"These patterns often coincide with new vulnerabilities emerging 2 to 4 weeks later.\" GreyNoise underlined the consistency in how the scanning activity is performed, suggesting that it could be part of an effort to test network defenses before attempting targeted exploitation. The researchers have also found a link to another activity they have been observing recently, concerning a PAN-OS crawler that also spiked on March 26, 2025, involving 2,580 IPs in its scans.

        "raw_content": "Google rolls out easy end-to-end encryption for Gmail business users By Sergiu Gatlan April 1, 2025 10:39 AM 0 ​Google has started rolling out a new end-to-end encryption (E2EE) model for Gmail enterprise users, making it easier to send encrypted emails to any recipient. While businesses also have the option to configure the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocol to send digitally signed and encrypted messages, this requires significant resources, including deploying certificates to all users and exchanging them before sending the emails. Google says that after Gmail's new E2EE model rolls out, business users will be able to send fully encrypted emails to any user on any email service or platform without having to worry about complex certificate requirements. \"This capability, requiring minimal efforts for both IT teams and end users, abstracts away the traditional IT complexity and substandard user experiences of existing solutions, while preserving enhanced data sovereignty, privacy, and security controls,\" Google said today. \"We're rolling this out in a phased approach, starting today, in beta, with the ability to send E2EE emails to Gmail users in your own organization. In the coming weeks, users will be able to send E2EE emails to any Gmail inbox, and, later this year, to any email inbox.\" Sending encrypted emails from Gmail (Google) ​To send a new encrypted email, Gmail users only have to turn on the \"Additional encription\" option when writing the message. The email will be automatically decrypted when the recipient is a Gmail user with an enterprise or personal account. Recipients using Google's Gmail mobile app or non-Gmail email clients will receive a link to sign in and view the email in a restricted version of Gmail. The recipient can then use a guest Google Workspace account to view and reply to the encrypted message. However, when the recipient has S/MIME configured on their account, Gmail will automatically send an E2EE email vi"

        "raw_content": "Genetic data site openSNP to close and delete data over privacy concerns By Bill Toulas April 2, 2025 05:09 PM 0 The openSNP project, a platform for sharing genetic and phenotypic data, will shut down on April 30, 2025, and delete all user submissions over privacy concerns and the risk of misuse by authoritarian governments. The decision was announced earlier this week by co-founder Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, who expressed concerns about how personal genomics data is subject to abuse today and how fundamentally the landscape has changed over the last 14 years. OpenSNP is a free and open-source platform where individuals can upload and share their genetic and phenotype data for research and educational purposes. Its original goal was to democratize access to genetic data, breaking the monopoly of commercial DNA testing companies and enabling researchers or regular people to explore human genetic data without financial or institutional barriers. Over the years, openSNP became one of the largest repositories of its kind, used in research, education, and even community-led investigations like debunking flawed CFS genetic studies. Although not affiliated with 23andMe, the vast majority of contributions it received were from users who had their genomes sequenced by 23andMe. With 23andMe filing for bankruptcy, the flow of new data submitted to openSNP has essentially stopped, and Tzovaras doesn't expect this to change any time soon. The co-founder also voiced concern that retaining openSNP's data could invite misuse, especially as private forensic firms, law enforcement agencies, and governments have become increasingly aggressive in seeking access to such information on the grounds of pseudo-scientific arguments. \"The risk/benefit calculus of providing free & open access to individual genetic data in 2025 is very different compared to 14 years ago,\" explained Tzovaras. \"And so, sunsetting openSNP – along with deleting the data stored within it – feels like it is the most "

        "raw_content": "A lifetime subscription to the AdGuard ad blocker is only $11 By BleepingComputer Deals April 3, 2025 07:09 AM 0 Intrusive advertisements and online tracking have become increasingly pervasive, affecting browsing speed, privacy, and security. If you want a simple solution, AdGuard can block ads of all kinds and help protect your privacy. It's also only $11 (reg. $79) for a lifetime subscription, but that deal won't last much longer. What can AdGuard do? AdGuard is designed to block unwanted advertisements and enhance your overall security online. It does that by using advanced filters that remove ads before they load. That means faster loading speed for webpages, reduced visual clutter, and a more seamless online experience across all devices. With the rise of aggressive tracking practices and the widespread sale of user data, AdGuard operates in the background to block invisible trackers, preventing companies from monitoring your browsing activity. This intuitive app also protects you against malicious websites and phishing schemes. Unlike standard browser extensions that only block ads on specific sites, AdGuard functions at the system level, filtering ads and trackers from websites, applications, and video content. This means advertisements on platforms like YouTube are removed, social media tracking is blocked, and disruptive pop-ups are eliminated. This subscription lasts for life with no recurring costs or hidden fees. You can use it on up to three desktop or mobile devices, including PC, Mac, iOS, and Android. Use code SOLOPLAN by April 27 at 11:59 p.m. PT to get an AdGuard Lifetime Subscription on sale for $11. Limited codes are available. Prices subject to change.

        "raw_content": "Verizon Call Filter API flaw exposed customers' incoming call history By Bill Toulas April 2, 2025 03:47 PM 0 A vulnerability in Verizon's Call Filter feature allowed customers to access the incoming call logs for another Verizon Wireless number through an unsecured API request. The flaw was discovered by security researcher Evan Connelly on February 22, 2025, and was fixed by Verizon sometime in the following month. However, the total period of exposure is unknown. Verizon's Call Filter app is a free utility that offers users spam detection and automatic call blocking. A paid version (Plus) adds a spam lookup and risk meter, the ability to apply blocks by type of caller, and receive caller ID on unknown numbers. The free version of the app comes pre-installed and enabled by default on eligible Android and iOS devices bought directly from Verizon, and is believed to be used on millions of devices. Connelly told BleepingComputer that he only tested the iOS app. However, he noted that the Android app was also very likely impacted by the same bug, as the issue was with the feature's API rather than the apps themselves. Exposing call histories When using the Call Filter app, Connelly discovered that the app would connect to an API endpoint, https://clr-aqx.cequintvzwecid.com/clr/callLogRetrieval, to retrieve the logged-in user's incoming call history and display it in the app. \"This endpoint requires a JWT (JSON Web Token) in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme and uses an X-Ceq-MDN header to specify a cell phone number to retrieve call history logs for,\" explains Connelly. \"A JWT has three parts: header, payload, and signature. It's often used for authentication and authorization in web apps.\" Connelly says the payload includes various data, including the phone number of the logged-in user making the request to the API. JWT payloadSource: Connelly However, the researcher discovered that the phone number in the JWT payload for the logged-in user was not ver"

In a new report by GitHub, the development company says the 39 million secrets were found through its secret scanning service, a security feature that detects API keys, passwords, tokens, and other secrets in repositories. \"Secret leaks remain one of the most common—and preventable—causes of security incidents,\" reads GitHub's announcement. \"As we develop code faster than ever previously imaginable, we're leaking secrets faster than ever, too.\" This is happening despite GitHub's targeted protection measures like \"Push Protection,\" which was introduced in April 2022 and was activated by default on all public repositories in February 2024. According to GitHub, the main reasons why secrets continue to leak are the prioritization of convenience by developers who handle secrets during commits and accidental repository exposure through git history. GitHub revamps Advanced Security GitHub announced several new measures and enhancements to existing systems to mitigate secret leaks on the platform. \"As of today, our security products are available to purchase as standalone products for enterprises, enabling development teams to scale security quickly,\" explained GitHub. \"Previously, investing in secret scanning and push protection required purchasing a larger suite of security tools, which made it too expensive for many organizations. \"This change ensures scalable security with Secret Protection and Code Security is no longer out of reach for many organizations.\" The GitHub Advanced Security changes are summarized as follows: Standalone Secret Protection and Code Security – Now available as separate products, these tools no longer require"

        "raw_content": "How to access the Dark Web using the Tor Browser Alec Abrams August 8, 2024 Read 163,506 times The dark web refers to websites that are not on the regular internet but are instead hidden in a private network that is only accessible using specialized web browsers, such as the Tor Browser. The Tor Browser is an open-source web browser created for anonymous browsing and to evade censorship. It routes users' traffic through thousands of volunteer-run servers called nodes/relays. These nodes/relays and the websites operating on them make up the Tor network, or as it is more generally named, the dark web. Sites running on the Tor network are called Onion sites as the URLs end with the \".onion\" TLD, such as the CIA's website at http://ciadotgov4sjwlzihbbgxnqg3xiyrg7so2r2o3lt5wz5ypk4sxyjstad.onion. Notice how the URL ends with the .onion TLD. These sites are only accessible over the Tor network and are commonly used for privacy and anonymity. The Tor Browser also features many built-in protections that protect against tracking and fingerprinting. While the Tor network was not created for illegal activities, as it's harder to trace websites to their physical location, cybercriminals have also adopted it to host their websites. For example, ransomware gangs use the dark web to leak stolen data and extort victims, and dark web marketplaces sell illegal items, such as drugs, weapons, stolen credit cards, stolen credentials, and malware. However, not all sites running on the Dark Web are malicious. For example, legitimate sites, such as the BBC, the New York Times, ProPublica, and Facebook, have made their sites accessible as a Tor Onion URL to help people avoid government censorship. This guide will teach you how to install the Tor Browser in Windows easily so you can access the Dark Web or browse the web anonymously. The same general process applies to other operating systems, as Tor is also available for Mac and Linux. How to Install Tor To gain access to the Dark Web, you mu"

        "raw_content": "How to backup and restore the Windows Registry Lawrence Abrams April 24, 2023 Read 163,073 times The Windows Registry is a crucial Windows operating system component that stores configuration settings and options. However, if you incorrectly make changes to the Registry, it could cause Windows to no longer start, for it to crash unexpectedly, or for applications to no longer work correctly. Therefore, it is always essential to back up the Windows Registry before making any changes. In this tutorial, we will explain how to manually backup the Windows Registry and save it to a file. To create a backup of the Registry, please follow these steps: Step 1: Open the Registry Editor Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box. Opening the Registry EditorSource: BleepingComputer Type \"regedit\" (without quotes) in the text box and click \"OK\" or press Enter. A Windows User Account Control (UAC) prompt will now be displayed, where you should click Yes to continue. Registry Editor UAC PromptSource: BleepingComputer Step 2: Click on the Export button In the Registry Editor, click on 'File' in the top-left corner of the window. From the drop-down menu, select 'Export' to open the Export Registry File dialog box. Select the Export option in the Windows Registry EditorSource: BleepingComputer Step 3: Choose a Backup Location and File Name In the Export Registry File dialog box, navigate to the storage folder where you want to save the backup file. Type a descriptive file name for your backup in the 'File name' field. For example, 'manual-backup-04-24-23.reg'. Make sure the 'Save as type' field is set to 'Registration Files (*.reg)'. In the 'Export range' section, you can choose whether to download All of the Registry (default selection) or specific parts of the Registry you want to backup. Select 'All' to back up the entire Registry or 'Selected branch' to paste a full Registry key path to backup from. For example, a full registry path is \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Micros"

        "raw_content": "Microsoft uses AI to find flaws in GRUB2, U-Boot, Barebox bootloaders By Bill Toulas March 31, 2025 03:56 PM 0 Microsoft used its AI-powered Security Copilot to discover 20 previously unknown vulnerabilities in the GRUB2, U-Boot, and Barebox open-source bootloaders. GRUB2 (GRand Unified Bootloader) is the default boot loader for most Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, while U-Boot and Barebox are commonly used in embedded and IoT devices. Microsoft discovered eleven vulnerabilities in GRUB2, including integer and buffer overflows in filesystem parsers, command flaws, and a side-channel in cryptographic comparison. Additionally, 9 buffer overflows in parsing SquashFS, EXT4, CramFS, JFFS2, and symlinks were discovered in U-Boot and Barebox, which require physical access to exploit. The newly discovered flaws impact devices relying on UEFI Secure Boot, and if the right conditions are met, attackers can bypass security protections to execute arbitrary code on the device. While exploiting these flaws would likely need local access to devices, previous bootkit attacks like BlackLotus achieved this through malware infections. \"While threat actors would likely require physical device access to exploit the U-boot or Barebox vulnerabilities, in the case of GRUB2, the vulnerabilities could further be exploited to bypass Secure Boot and install stealthy bootkits or potentially bypass other security mechanisms, such as BitLocker,\" explains Microsoft. \"The implications of installing such bootkits are significant, as this can grant threat actors complete control over the device, allowing them to control the boot process and operating system, compromise additional devices on the network, and pursue other malicious activities.\" \"Furthermore, it could result in persistent malware that remains intact even after an operating system reinstallation or a hard drive replacement.\" Below is a summary of the flaws Microsoft uncovered in GRUB2: CVE-2024-56737 – Buffer overflow in HFS files"

        "raw_content": "North Korean IT worker army expands operations in Europe By Sergiu Gatlan April 1, 2025 02:55 PM 0 ​North Korea's IT workers have expanded operations beyond the United States and are now increasingly targeting organizations across Europe. Also referred to as \"IT warriors,\" they hide their true identities and pose as workers based in other countries by connecting via laptop farms to fraudulently secure positions as remote freelance IT employees at companies worldwide to generate revenue for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) regime. As security researchers with the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) found, North Korea's IT army has increasingly targeted positions at companies in Germany, Portugal, and the United Kingdom after many of its members have been charged and targeted with sanctions in the United States. \"In their efforts to secure these positions, DPRK IT workers employed deceptive tactics, falsely claiming nationalities from a diverse set of countries, including Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Ukraine, the United States, and Vietnam. The identities used were a combination of real and fabricated personas,\" said Jamie Collier, a lead threat intelligence advisor at GTIG. \"IT workers in Europe were recruited through various online platforms, including Upwork, Telegram, and Freelancer. Payment for their services was facilitated through cryptocurrency, the TransferWise service, and Payoneer, highlighting the use of methods that obfuscate the origin and destination of funds.\" Countries targeted by DPRK IT workers (GTIG) ​For instance, GTIG investigators discovered user credentials at European job websites and human capital management platforms linked to DRPK IT worker personas looking for employment at German and Portuguese companies. North Korean IT workers have also been linked to many projects in the United Kingdom, ranging from AI and blockchain technology to web, bot, and content management system (CMS) development.

        "raw_content": "Apple fined €150 million over App Tracking Transparency issues By Sergiu Gatlan April 1, 2025 12:37 PM 5 Autorité de la concurrence, France's antitrust watchdog, has fined Apple €150 million ($162 million) for using the App Tracking Transparency privacy framework to abuse its dominant market position in mobile app advertising on its devices. App Tracking Transparency (ATT) requires apps to request users' permission to collect their data for targeted advertising purposes before tracking them across websites, apps, and services owned by other companies. Apple introduced the data privacy tool in June 2020 and began enforcing its use in April 2021 with the release of iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5. The French competition authority said that although ATT's goal is not inherently problematic, its implementation is neither necessary nor proportionate to Apple's declared objective of protecting its customers' personal information. \"ATT as implemented by Apple penalised smaller publishers in particular since, unlike the main vertically integrated platforms, they depend to a large extent on third-party data collection to finance their business,\" the competition regulator said. \"Although the introduction of ATT has impacted all application publishers, the framework has been particularly harmful for smaller publishers that do not enjoy alternative targeting possibilities, in particular in the absence of sufficient proprietary data.\" As the French competition watchdog explained, the ATT framework fails to comply with GDPR standards due to its lack of neutrality and the overly complicated user experience it implements. Using multiple consent pop-ups puts app publishers at a disadvantage, as users must confirm tracking consent twice but can easily refuse it with a single click, the Autorité de la concurrence said. ATT also creates an imbalance, given that user access to Apple apps is easier because the company exempts its apps from the regulations that third-party app publishers must fo"

It allows advertisers to track user activity across apps and websites for targeted advertising while maintaining user anonymity. Users can reset or disable IDFA through privacy settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>France&#8217;s Autorité found Apple&#8217;s ATT framework, while not inherently problematic, was implemented in a way that was unnecessary and disproportionate. Apple&#8217;s ATT framework caused excessive pop-ups, complicating third-party app use. It lacked neutrality and harmed smaller publishers reliant on third-party data, leading to economic disadvantages for app developers and ad service providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;As part of its investigation into the merits of the case, the Autorité found that while the objective of the App Tracking Transparency (“ATT”) framework is not at its core problematic, how ATT is implemented is neither necessary for nor proportionate with Apple’s stated objective of protecting personal data.&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/press-release/targeted-advertising-autorite-de-la-concurrence-imposes-fine-eu150000000-apple\"><strong>report</strong></a> published by France&#8217;s Autorité de la concurrence.</em></p>\n\n\n<d"

According to\ndata\nreleased by\nNCC Group, the resurgence is being led by old ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups.\nWith data gathered by “actively monitoring the leak sites used by each ransomware group and scraping victim details as they are released,” researchers have determined that Lockbit was by far the most prolific ransomware gang in July, behind 62 attacks. That’s ten more than the month prior, and more than twice as many as the second and third most prolific groups combined. “Lockbit 3.0 maintain their foothold as the most threatening ransomware group,” the authors wrote, “and one with which all organizations should aim to be aware of.”\nThose second and third most prolific groups are Hiveleaks – 27 attacks – and BlackBasta – 24 attacks. These figures represent rapid rises for each group – since June, a 440 percent rise for Hiveleaks, and a 50 percent rise for BlackBasta.\nIt may well be that the resurgence in ransomware attacks, and the rise of these two particular groups, are intimately connected.\nWhy Ransomware Has Bounced\nResearchers from NCC Group counted 198 successful ransomware campaigns in July – up 47 percent from June. Sharp as that incline may be, it still falls some ways short of the high-water mark set this Spring, with nearly 300 such campaigns in both March and April.\nWhy the Flux?\nWell, in May, the United States government ramped up its efforts against Russian cybercrime by\noffering\nup to $15 million for prized information about Conti, then the world’s foremost ransomware gang. “It is likely that the threat actors that were undergoing structural changes,” the authors of the report speculated, “and have begun settling into their new modes of operating, resulting in t"

Their customers span over 100 countries (including the United States, despite the FCC labeling Hikvision “an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security” in 2019).\nLast Fall, a command injection flaw in Hikvision cameras was revealed to the world as\nCVE-2021-36260\n. The exploit was given a “critical” 9.8 out of 10 rating by NIST.\nDespite the severity of the vulnerability, and nearly a year into this story, over 80,000 affected devices remain unpatched. In the time since, the researchers have discovered “multiple instances of hackers looking to collaborate on exploiting Hikvision cameras using the command injection vulnerability,” specifically in Russian dark web forums, where leaked credentials have been put up for sale.\nThe extent of the damage done already is unclear. The authors of the report could only speculate that “Chinese threat groups such as MISSION2025/APT41, APT10 and its affiliates, as well as unknown Russian threat actor groups could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in these devices to fulfill their motives (which may include specific geo-political considerations).”\nThe Risk in IoT Devices\nWith stories like this, it’s easy to ascribe laziness to individuals and organizations that leave their software unpatched. But the story isn’t always so simple.\nAccording to David Maynor, senior director of threat intelligence at Cybrary, Hikvision cameras have been vulnerable for many reasons, and for a while. “Their product "

Federal agencies urged to patch the bug by September 9.\nEarlier this month, Palo Alto Networks issued a fix for the high-severity bug (CVE-2022-0028) that it says adversaries attempted to exploit. The flaw could be used by remote hackers to carry out reflected and amplified denial-of-service (DoS) attacks without having to authenticate targeted systems.\nPalo Alto Networks maintains the flaw can only be exploited on a limited number of systems, under certain conditions and that the vulnerable systems are not part of a common firewall configuration. Any additional attacks exploiting the bug have either not occurred or been publicly reported.\nAffected Products and OS Versions\nAffected products include those running the PAN-OS firewall software include PA-Series, VM-Series and CN-Series devices. PAN-OS versions vulnerable to attack, with patches available, include PAN-OS prior to 10.2.2-h2, PAN-OS prior to 10.1.6-h6, PAN-OS prior to 10.0.11-h1, PAN-OS prior to 9.1.14-h4, PAN-OS prior to 9.0.16-h3 and PAN-OS prior to 8.1.23-h1.\nAccording to\nPalo Alto Networks advisory\n; “A PAN-OS URL filtering policy misconfiguration could allow a network-based attacker to conduct reflected and amplified TCP denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks. The DoS attack would appear to originate from a Palo Alto Networks PA-Series (hardware), VM-Series (virtual) and CN-Series (container) firewall against an attacker-specified target.”\nThe advisory describes the non-standard configuration at risk as the “firewall configuration must have a URL filtering profile"

After a lull in activity, believed tied to COVID-related travel restrictions, the threat group has ramped up campaigns to exploit an uptick in travel and related airline and hotel bookings.\nWarnings come from security researchers who say TA558 cybercriminals have revamped their 2018 campaigns with fake reservation emails that contain links – that if clicked – deliver a malicious malware payload containing a potpourri of malware variants.\nWhat makes this most recent campaign unique, according to a report by\nProofpoint\n, is the use of RAR and ISO file attachments linked to messages. ISO and RAR are single compressed files, that if executed, decompress the file and folder data inside of them.\n“TA558 began using URLs more frequently in 2022. TA558 conducted 27 campaigns with URLs in 2022, compared to just five campaigns total from 2018 through 2021. Typically, URLs led to container files such as ISOs or zip [RAR] files containing executables,” Proofpoint wrote.\nTo become infected, the targeted victim would have to be tricked into decompressing the file archive. “The reservation link… led to an ISO file and an embedded batch file. The execution of the BAT file led to a PowerShell helper script that downloaded a follow-on payload, AsyncRAT,” researchers wrote.\nUpgrade Your Itinerary To Malware Infection Status\nPast TA558 campaigns, tracked by Palo Alto Networks (\nin 2018\n), Cisco Talos (\nin 2020\nand\n2021\n) and Uptycs (\nin 2020\n), have leveraged malicious Microsoft Word document attachments (CVE-2017-11882) or remote template URLs to download and install malware, according to Proofpoint.\nThe shif"

The patches are for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code and ultimately take over devices.\nPatches are available for effected devices running\niOS 15.6.1\nand\nmacOS Monterey 12.5.1\n. Patches address two flaws, which basically impact any Apple device that can run either iOS 15 or the Monterey version of its desktop OS, according to security updates released by Apple Wednesday.\nOne of the flaws is a kernel bug (\nCVE-2022-32894\n), which is present both in iOS and macOS. According to Apple it is an “out-of-bounds write issue [that] was addressed with improved bounds checking.”\nThe vulnerability allows an application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, according to Apple, which, in usual vague fashion, said there is a report that it “may have been actively exploited.”\nThe second flaw is identified as a WebKit bug (tracked as CVE-2022-32893), which is an out-of-bounds write issue that Apple addressed with improved bounds checking. The flaw allows for processing maliciously crafted web content that can lead to code execution, and also has been reported to be under active exploit, according to Apple. WebKit is the browser engine that powers Safari and all other third-party browsers that work on iOS.\nPegasus-Like Scenario\nThe discovery of both flaws, about which little more beyond Apple’s disclosure are known, was credited to an anonymous researcher.\nOne expert expressed worry that the latest Apple flaws “could effectively give attackers full access to device,” they might create a\nPegasus-like\nscenario"

If adversaries could manufacture convincing falsehoods faster than defenders could debunk them, trust in elections — and democracy itself — could be eroded as never before.\nThat same AI-powered deception is already being weaponized beyond the political sphere with attackers using\ngenerative AI\nto impersonate executives, bypass identity verification systems, and automate large-scale fraud. AI-generated business email compromise (BEC) scams, synthetic identities, and deepfake-assisted phishing campaigns have surged in the past year. The same tactics designed to manipulate voters are being repurposed for cyber-enabled financial crimes, corporate espionage, and social engineering attacks — with far fewer defenses in place.\nYet, despite the dire warnings, AI-driven manipulation failed to upend elections in 2024. While there were alarming examples — including deepfake robocalls impersonating US President Joe Biden to suppress voter turnout and AI-generated hoaxes targeting Taiwanese elections — most incidents were quickly debunked. Their actual influence on electoral outcomes remained limited.\nBut that does not mean AI-driven deception is overhyped.

He is now a pentester with Counter Hack Challenges, a certified instructor with training organization SANS, and a brigade operations officer (S3) with the Virginia National Guard.\nMatching military experience with skills on the outside is key\nHis experience isn’t uncommon among those switching from one profession to cybersecurity. Indeed, many people struggle with articulating how prior work experience speaks to an open security role and finding mentors who can guide them in their new careers.\nBut Elgee and others say such challenges can be more pronounced for veterans as they transition out of the military because of its unique work and culture.\nRecognizing such challenges matters, they add, exp"

Traditional security strategies that focus solely on indicators of compromise (IoCs) are proving insufficient against the scale and speed of modern cyberattacks.\nTo address today’s challenges, organizations must adopt a threat-informed defense approach—one that shifts the focus from reactive responses to proactive, intelligence-driven security operations.\nThe rise of cybercrime-as-a-service\nToday’s macro threat landscape is a flourishing ecosystem of cybercrime facilitated by crime-as-a-service (CaaS) models. Cybercriminal networks now operate like legitimate businesses, with specialized units dedicated to activities such as money laundering, malware development, and spear phishing. This ecosystem lowers the barrier to entry for cybercrime, enabling low-skilled adversaries to launch highly targeted and disruptive attacks with minimal effort.\nOne of the most concerning trends is the rise of reconnaissance-as-a-service, where threat actors conduct extensive network mapping before an attack. This intelligence is then packaged and sold to the highest bidder, increasing the likelihood of successful breaches. And with the weaponization of AI now in place, these reconnaissance efforts have become more automated and precise, allowing cybercriminals to scale their operations at an unprecedented rate.\nThe convergence of IT and OT threats\nCybercrime has historically targeted IT systems, while nation-state actors have focused on disrupting\noperational technology\n(OT) environments.

The bespoke “worker” has these permissions, which attackers could potentially use to pull private Google Artifact Registry (GAR) and Google Container Registry (GCR) images from the same account.\nPrivate images are restricted and require authentication to access. They are used to store proprietary applications, configurations, or sensitive code.\nThe worker, aka service agent, “is a special type of service account created and managed by Google Cloud,” said Liv Matan, senior security researcher at Tenable. “If an attacker "

How do we figure out which ones to prioritize?”\nI responded with a generic answer along the lines of “prioritize based on known threats to your organization,” or “prioritize based on the business criticality of the asset.” It was accurate, but vague. Fast forward more than 20 years, and the audience member’s predicament and question still vex many organizations.\nWhat has changed, however, is the scale of the problem. In 2003, enterprise organizations had thousands of active vulnerabilities. Now they face hundreds of thousands or more. Meanwhile, many organizations have the same challenges they did years ago — a lack of experienced staff, manual processes, misaligned goals between security and other teams (IT ops, software development), and more.\nSince modern enterprises run on software, poor vulnerability management represents a serious business risk. So, how are CISOs modernizing their programs to improve risk mitigation? Over the past several months, I spoke to a dozen security executives to find out.

Later this year, the feature will be expanded to allow the sending of encrypted emails to any email users, including those from other providers.\nE2EE differs from encrypting email communication in transit between email servers, which is already achieved with\nTLS\n(transport layer security), or at rest when stored in Google’s data centers. E2EE allows users to encrypt sent messages in a way that only the intended recipients can decrypt and read them.\nHow end-to-end encryption works\nE2EE for email is typically achieved with Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), a public protocol and standard that uses public-key cryptography to sign and encrypt messages. However, implementing S/MIME is not straightforward, usually involving digital certificate acquisition and management for every user. Additionally, it only works with recipients who also have S/MIME configured.\nThere are proprietary solutions for end-to-end encryption that involve deploying additional software, browser extensions, or web portals. Organizations in certain regulated industry sectors, including government agencies, typically go through the trouble of setting up such E2EE solutions for sensitive emails, but most other organizations avoid them due to usability issues.\n“These gaps and challenges have created real friction for both IT teams and users for decades,” Johney Burke, senior product manager at Google Workspace, told CSO. “Organizations resolve these issues either through incredibly intricate and expensive IT management or by minimizing communications with entities outside their company.

This includes, by the government’s own estimates, up to an additional 1,100 managed service providers, 64 data center operators, and an unspecified number of smaller companies in the digital supply chain.\nThe government acknowledges that, if implemented in full, this will impose new costs, which means that the business customers using those providers will face higher bills at some point.\nMany of these providers are not currently subject to existing cybersecurity legislation governing critical national infrastructure, primarily the Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018 (UK). The new legislation will bring the UK more into line with the regulation’s EU successor,\nNIS2\n.\n“While we expect this measure to have associated costs related to security improvements and compliance, these investments will position MSPs as trusted and reliable partners in the cyber security landscape,” the\ngovernment’s policy statement said\n.\nWhat will the bill change?\nAs well as broader oversight, the bill will impose tougher reporting requirements, requiring companies to notify the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of a significant incident within 24 hours. The definition of ‘significant’ will include anything compromising data, as well as, significantly, supply chain attacks affecting customers (\nstand up Snowflake\n).\nThe emphasis on resilience means that providers will have to explain how they would recover fr"

With\nmachine identities\nnow far outnumbering human ones, securing these digital credentials has become a top cybersecurity priority for enterprises. However, as the CyberArk\n2025 State of Machine Identity Security Report\nshows, many of the 1,200 security leaders in organizations we surveyed—across the U.S., U.K., Australia, France, Germany, and Singapore—are struggling to effectively manage their machine identities, exposing them to significant risks.\nMachine identities—unique digital credentials, such as TLS certificates, used by devices, applications, APIs, and cloud-native technologies—are critical for secure communication in modern systems. Yet their explosive growth, high turnover, and susceptibility to compromise drive complexity and increase risks for organizations.\nThe report’s findings reveal the challenges organizations face and how prepared organizations feel to address these machine identity risks. Here, we’ll explore the growth of machine identities, the associated risks, and the strategies organizations can adopt to help mitigate these challenges.\nThe growth of machine identities and the associated risks\nMachine identities are experiencing exponential growth, with 79% of organizations predicting increases over the next year and 16% of those expecting radical growth of 50 to 150%. Cloud-native technologies, microservices, and artificial intelligence (AI) drive this surge because they’re environments where identities are created and discarded dynamically in minutes.\nUnfortunately, this growth comes with amplified risks.

This transition isn’t always easy because, historically, CISOs delegated identity-related matters to Identity and Access Management (IAM) teams, viewing it primarily as a check-box compliance exercise. Now that identity security has become so crucial to the success (or failure) of an organization’s overall cybersecurity strategy, CISOs must have a solid executive understanding of its role in protecting the enterprise.\nThis post aims to provide security leaders with the essential insights needed to actively engage in identity-related architecture and strategy decisions.\nIdentity: The decision point\nPerimeter-based security models built to keep attackers out won’t work when\n60% of breaches\nnow involve valid credentials.

That’s why identities are so valuable. Attackers can target them instead of sniffing out vulnerabilities or deploying malware to exfiltrate sensitive data—tactics that take time and effort. With valid credentials linked to a human or machine identity, attackers can slip in, bypass security controls and operate undetected—sometimes for extended periods—without anyone knowing.\nIn more good news for the bad guys, identities are everywhere.

Das Problem ist, dass Hersteller dazu keine Patches mehr herausgeben.\n„Dies unterstreicht, wie wichtig es ist, veraltete Komponenten des Netzwerks einer Organisation so schnell wie möglich außer Betrieb zu nehmen und zu ersetzen“, betonen die Security-Forscher. Die Studie offenbart: Die beiden Sicherheitslücken – CVE-2024-3273 und CVE-2024-3272 in netzwerkgebundenen Speichergeräten von D-Link, in Kombination mit einer dritten (CVE-2024-24919) in den Quantum Security Gateways von Check Point Software – machten mehr als die Hälfte der Schwachstellen bei Netzwerkgeräten aus, die von Bedrohungsakteuren im vergangenen Jahr missbraucht wurden.\n„Viele dieser Schwachstellen wurden größtenteils von bekannten Botnets wie\nMirai\nund Gafgyt ausgenutzt.

Security controls rarely get the same validation. Instead, success criteria become “don’t break production,” which doesn’t actually test whether the security controls are effective.\nIt’s not for lack of trying, but traditional methods—such as compliance audits and penetration tests—don’t fully answer the question, “\nWould we win?\n” if attacked.\nAs a result, blind spots persist.\nTraditional Security Testing Falls Short\nCompliance audits\nfocus on policy and process but rarely engage in operational assurance testing that confirms, “\nDoes this actually work as expected?\n”\nAnswering “Do you have antivirus software?” is very different from “How long does it take for a malicious file to be removed and your team to be alerted?”\nPenetration tests can highlight security gaps but often reflect a specific attack path chosen by the testers rather than a comprehensive evaluation of all potential failure points.\nThe end result? Gaps (or blind spots) that typically aren’t discovered until someone else finds them for you.\nFive Most Common Reasons Security Controls Fail\nFailures occur in both security tools—such as Secure Email Gateways (SEGs), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems—and in security teams, whether in-house or managed detection and response (MDR) providers.\nWe can categorize these into organizations threat prevention, detection, and response investments.\nA Case Study: How a Leading Healthcare System Proactively Removed Security Control Failures\nLearn how OnDefend’s Bli"

But this quarter, it’s Steam, and by a significant margin. Scammers have been targeting the massive gaming community by impersonating Steam to warn users about supposed account issues, like payment failures or suspicious login attempts. These fake messages are designed to trick victims into entering their login credentials on counterfeit websites, which then steal their account information,” the researchers noted.\n“If you get an unexpected email or text about your Steam account or a supposed gift card reward, always double-check the URL and resist clicking on any links until you’re absolutely sure it’s legitimate.”\nElectronic toll collection-related phishing surges\nThe top 10 most imitated brands in Q1 2025 were, according to the company:\n1. Steam\n(digital game distribution service by Valve)\n2. Microsoft\n3. Facebook/Meta\n4. Roblox\n(online game platform and game creation system)\n5. SunPass\n(electronic toll collection company)\n6.

For the second year in row, compromised credentials were the number one root cause of attacks (41% of cases). This was followed by exploited\nvulnerabilities\n(21.79%) and brute force attacks (21.07%).\nWhen analyzing MDR  and IR investigations, the Sophos X-Ops team looked specifically at ransomware, data exfiltration, and data extortion cases to identify how fast attackers progressed through the stages of an attack within an organization. In those three types of cases, the median time between the start of an attack and exfiltration was only 72.98 hours (3.04 days). Furthermore, there was only a median of 2.7 hours from exfiltration to attack detection.\nThe lack of visibility for files moving around the network – and of missing logs – also contributes to exfiltration statistics. In 2024, analysts were able to confirm that\nexfiltration\noccurred in 27% of cases. Including evidence of data staging and possible exfiltration, this rises to 36%. Ransomware victims had their data exfiltrated in 43% of the incidents investigated. An additional 14% had possible exfiltration or evidence of data staging.\n“Passive security is no longer enough. While prevention is essential, rapid response is critical. Organizations must actively monitor networks and act swiftly against observed telemetry. Coordinated attacks by motivated adversaries require a coordinated defense. For many organizations, that means combining business-specific knowledge with expert-led detection and response,” said\nJ"

However, compared to the same period last year, the overall malware count more than doubled.\nKey findings from the Open Source Malware Index, Q1 2025 include:\nData exfiltration malware dominates:\n56% of the malware discovered in Q1 2025 was related to\ndata exfiltration\n, designed to harvest sensitive information from infected systems, a dramatic increase from 26% in Q4 2024. This rise highlights the growing concern of sensitive information being compromised via malicious open source components.\nCrypto miners remain steady:\nCrypto-mining malware made up 7% of malicious packages discovered in Q1 2025, doubling from 3.5% in Q4 2024, showing that resource-hijacking attacks are still prevalent in open source ecosystems.\nFinancial services and government institutions defending attacks:\nSonatype helped block more than 20,000 open source malware attacks in Q1 2025 — 66% at financial services companies, 14% at government organisations, and 7% in the utilities, oil & gas sector.\nOpen source malware ‘noise’ decreasing:\n80% of logged packages in Q1 2025 were made up of more sophisticated and threatening types of\nmalware\n, such as droppers and code injection malware.\n“The data shows a meaningful change in how ecosystem maintainers are taking action against harmful components, but it also reflects the growing sophistication of threat actors,” said\nBrian Fox\n, CTO of Sonatype. “We have seen a rise in more sophisticated types of open source malware, showing that attackers are innovating in w"

Users paid for access using cryptocurrencies, earning tokens by contributing to the platform’s operations.\nUnlike other dark web platforms, Kidflix prioritized streaming functionality, making its content more accessible to offenders. Notably, the platform also allowed video previews with varying quality tiers, further monetizing child abuse content.\nUnprecedented Results\nThe server hosting Kidflix was seized on March 11, 2025, in a joint effort by German and Dutch authorities. To date, the investigation has resulted in:\n1,393 suspects identified\nworldwide,\n79 arrests\n, including individuals who committed direct abuse,\n3,000 electronic devices seized\n, and\n39 children protected\n.\nEuropol has called this the largest child sexual exploitation operation in its history.\nA "

This difficulty is compounded when obfuscation tools like Garble are used to obscure function and package names.\nGarble’s obfuscation properties strip symbol tables and randomize names, making manual static analysis tedious and time-consuming.\nGarble Obfuscation Properties Analysis\nVolexity’s\ninvestigations\nfrequently encounter Golang malware, prompting the need for advanced solutions to address the challenges posed by such obfuscators. GoResolver was developed in response to this need.\nIntroducing GoResolver\nGoResolver is a groundbreaking open-source tool that leverages control-flow graph similarity techniques to resolve obfuscated function names.\nBy analyzing the paths a binary takes during execution, GoResolver can identify similarities between control-flow graphs of obfuscated and clean binaries, restoring symbol information that would otherwise be lost.\nThis approach significantl"

However, a researcher recently found the app vulnerable to a serious security lapse.\nAt the core of this issue was the app’s interaction with Verizon’s servers to fetch call history data. A network request sent to the endpoint /clr/callLogRetrieval facilitated this retrieval.\nA critical flaw lay in how the app failed to validate that the phone number being queried matched the phone number tied to the signed-in user.\nBy modifying the phone number in the request header (X-Ceq-MDN) while keeping a valid authorization token (JWT), an attacker could fetch call log data for any Verizon customer.\nThe JWT payload looked like this:\n{\n\n    \"sub\": \"SIGNED_IN_USER_PHONE_NUMBER_HERE\",\n\n    \"iat\": \"1740253712\",\n\n    \"iss\": \"df88f1ed1dfd9a903e4c8dca7f00089e134c6c4e0a566cd565147ba1dadf78a6\",\n\n    \"secret\": \"REDACTED\",\n\n    \"alg\": \"ECDSA-256\",\n\n    \"exp\": \"1740255512\"\n\n}\nWhy This Matters\nCall logs might seem inconsequential, but they are far more revealing than they appear.\nMetadata such as timestamps and call durations can paint a picture of an individual’s daily routine, personal relationships, and confidential contacts.\nExample Vulnerable Request\nFor high-risk individuals like journalists, law enforcement officers, politicians, or d"

The last decade has seen the advent of “consumable” AI, triggering mass adoption and application in our business and personal lives. The pace of AI maturity as it enters its eighth decade has led industry experts to name this the “intelligent era” and I wholeheartedly agree.</p>\n<p>Until the last ten years or so, we would largely categorise robots as “reactive” with mostly industrial applications in areas like manufacturing or warehousing. I recall my first job as a Chocolate Engineer in the mid 90’s where I was wowed by robotic packaging systems and couldn’t even imagine then how we now apply robots to achieve huge efficiency and quality advances across our industries today. With the Autonomous capabilities that AI/ML is making real, ever more impressive applications for robots are now applied and most notably in our digital landscapes with Agentic AI poised to re-architect the workforce in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>Autonomous AI agents as our workforces or perhaps as the foot soldiers to decentralised applications in a Web 3.0 world, represent perhaps the most disruptive technology to transform IT, our industries and how businesses operate. At an individual level, this will change how we interact with each other as citizens, with our governments, perform our jobs and consume goods and services. Throw in"

IT teams are often stretched, while c-suite executives don’t fully understand how technical misconfigurations, or a lack of certain controls, could impact their business. vSOC Assure has been developed to address these challenges, making it easier to identify, track and manage risks. The platform streamlines cyber risk assessments across an organisation’s entire digital environment, while delivering action points for c-suite and technical teams to improve resilience,” said Simon Kean, Commercial Director at Data Connect.</p>\n<p>The service carries out an in-depth assessment on an organisation’s security posture, benchmarked against globally-recognised frameworks. The risks are then communicated back to the organisation alongside a clear and structured roadmap for remediation, which ensures organisations have an action plan set to address issues effectively.</p>\n<p>The service is also designed to bridge communication gaps between IT leaders and c-suite executives. This ensures that employees at every level are delivered information relevant to their understanding of risk, while empowering them to play a key role in improving organisational cyber maturity.</p>\n<p>“We offer support to organisations after the assessment, helping them prioritise ri"

That&#8217;s why Kaspersky researchers analyze the trends related to these threats and share an annual report highlighting the main dangers to corporate and consumer finances. This report contains key trends and statistics on financial phishing, mobile and PC banking malware, as well as offers actionable recommendations to bolster security measures and effectively mitigate emerging threats</p>\n<h2 id=\"methodology\">Methodology</h2>\n<p>In this report, we present an analysis of financial cyberthreats in 2024, focusing on banking Trojans and phishing pages that target online banking, shopping accounts, cryptocurrency wallets and other financial assets. To gain an understanding of the financial threat landscape, we analyzed anonymized data on malicious activities detected on the devices of Kaspersky security product users and consensually provided to us through the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN). Note that for mobile banking malware, we retrospectively revised the 2023 numbers to provide more accurate statistics. We also changed the methodology for PC banking malware by removing obsolete families that no longer use Trojan banker functionality, hence the sharp drop in numbers against 2023.</p>\n<h2 id=\"key-findings\">Key findings</h2>\n<p><strong>Phishing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Banks were the most popular lure in 2024, accounting for 42.58% of financial phishing attempts.</li>\n<li>Amazon Online Shopping was mimicked by 33.19% of all phishing and scam pages targeting online store users in 2024.</li>\n<li>Cryptocurrency phishing saw an 83.37% year-over-year"

What&#8217;s intriguing about this malware is how much it collects. It grabs account information from VPN and gaming clients, and all kinds of network utilities like ngrok, Playit, Cyberduck, FileZilla and DynDNS. The stealer was named Arcane, not to be confused with the well-known Arcane Stealer V. The malicious actor behind Arcane went on to release a similarly named loader, which supposedly downloads cheats and cracks, but in reality delivers malware to the victim&#8217;s device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"distribution\">Distribution</h2>\n<p>The campaign in which we discovered the new stealer was already active before Arcane appeared. The original distribution method started with YouTube videos promoting game cheats. The videos were frequently accompanied by a link to an archive and a password to unlock it. Upon unpacking the archive, the user would invariably discover a start.bat batch file in the root folder and the UnRAR.exe utility in one of the subfolders.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115921\" style=\"width: 425px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18142056/arcane-stealer.png\"><img alt=\"Archive root\" class=\"size-full wp-image-115921\" height=\"139\" src=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/03/18142056/arcane-stealer.png\" width=\"415\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-115921\">Archive root</p></div>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_115922\" style=\"width: 392px;\"><a class=\"magnificImage\" href=\"https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2"

Additionally, Head Mare attacks utilized command-and-control (C2) servers exclusively linked to Twelve prior to these incidents. This suggests potential collaboration and joint campaigns between the two groups.</p>\n<p>The attackers continue to refine their methods, employing both familiar tools from past Head Mare incidents and new PowerShell-based tools.</p>\n<p>This report analyzes the software and techniques observed in recent Head Mare attacks and how these overlap with Twelve&#8217;s activities.

Celebrated annually on <strong>April 3rd</strong>, this day serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of implementing strong security measures to combat the rising cyber threats targeting cloud infrastructure. With cybercriminals becoming more sophisticated, ensuring data security, integrity, and privacy has never been more critical.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The Rising Cybersecurity Challenges in the Cloud</strong></span></p>\n<p>A recent survey by <a href=\"https://www.rapid7.com/\"><strong>Rapid7</strong></a> highlights the increasing cybersecurity risks faced by the cloud industry, particularly the surge in ransomware attacks and data breaches. One of the key reasons behind this growing vulnerability is the misconception among organizations—many believe that securing cloud applications and data is solely the responsibility of the service provider, leaving customers with little or no role in the process.</p>\n<p>This misunderstanding often results in lax security practices, such as failing to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) or encryption. Many users assume that once a contract or a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is signed with a cloud service provider (CSP), the security of their digital assets is fully managed by the provider. However, this false sense of security creates an opportunity for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The Role of AI-Powered Cyber Attacks</strong></span></p>\n<p>Hackers are leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to carry out sophisticated cyberattacks at an unprecedented scale.

Since these invitations often come from familiar sources, like a colleague, friend, or even a business partner, recipients are more likely to trust the message and click on the embedded link.

In many cases, they quickly change the account’s password to lock the legitimate user out and gain full access.</p>\n<p>A particularly worrying aspect of this type of attack is the increasing use of single sign-on (SSO) systems. Major online service providers such as Google, Amazon, and others often offer users the convenience of using one set of credentials to access multiple accounts within their ecosystem. While this makes it easier to manage logins, it also poses a security risk. If a hacker gains access to a single account, they could potentially unlock a range of services, making it much simpler for them to compromise sensitive data across multiple platforms.</p>\n<p>To defend against such attacks, it’s crucial to enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on all online accounts.

The move to autonomous AI Agents promises to be as big a leap forward as Generative AI was over traditional <a href=\"https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/most-secure-ai-models-for-enterprises/\">AI models</a>. Whereas traditional AI assisted with analysis and recommendations, Agentic AI works by understanding the environment, making decisions, and taking action without human involvement.  It is no surprise that Gartner lists Agentic AI as one of the top <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5850847\">strategic trends</a> in 2025 and anticipates it will resolve <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-03-05-gartner-predicts-agentic-ai-will-autonomously-resolve-80-percent-of-common-customer-service-issues-without-human-intervention-by-20290\">80%</a> of customer service issues by 2029.</p>\n<p>But with these massive advantages come new types of risks and threats. These risks go way beyond traditional AI problems like data poisoning and model poisoning due to the autonomy that AI agents possess. As Agentic AI can make decisions and interact with other AI agents in its own unique ecosystem, we are facing security challenges that conventional security has not encountered before. In this article, we will look at a few of these challenges and how to face them.</p>\n<p><strong>The Problem with Autonomous Agents</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned, the key feature that defines Agentic AI is autonomy, i.e., the ability to take actions without human involvement. This also creates security problems, such as rogue or compromised AI agents causing havoc in IT environments. For example, a security AI Agent could be taken over and used to lock users out of critical systems, make incorrect decisions, and weaken the security posture of an environment. This also poses the question of accountability, i.e., who is responsible for the actions that an AI agent takes? Is it the c"

        "raw_content": "Image\nOver the past few years, many countries have made considerable efforts to bolster\ncybersecurity preparedness\n. These efforts are understandable when put into a geopolitical context: global relationships in the past five years have been among the most tumultuous in decades, cybersecurity threats are more sophisticated than ever, and the world is increasingly reliant on digital technologies.\nHowever, many of these cybersecurity preparedness efforts are remarkably alike, with most of them including risk management frameworks, incident response and recovery support, and legal guidelines. It’s exceedingly rare for these efforts to stray from the norm - that is, until recently.\nIn early 2025, Japan passed two articles of legislation that constitute the Active Cyber Defense Bill. Much of the Bill is pretty standard, but its introduction of active measures - which empower Japan’s military and law enforcement agencies to take preemptive action against cyber threats - is more interesting. Let’s look at why.\nWhat Prompted the Bill?\nBut first, let’s explore the context. Even the situation that prompted Japan’s Active Cyber Defense Bill is somewhat unique. It comes in two parts.\nBlair Shock\nIn April 2022, the then-US Director of National Intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, publicly criticized Japan’s digital defenses. His remarks deeply impacted Japanese lawmakers and sparked what has come to be known as “Blair Shock,”\nAs such, unlike other countries, Japan’s\ncybersecurity\nlegislation is about more than just remedying a technological shortfall; it is about restoring national confidence and asserting Japan’s commitment to protecting its critical infrastructure and industrial base. The Active Defense Bill is a direct outcome of this wake-up call and, consequently, takes an innovative, proactive, and, some may argue, extreme approach to improving cybersecurity preparedness.\nGeopolitical Challenges\nGeopolitical pressures also significantly influenced the development of Japan’s Acti"

It includes security standards pertaining to a list of agreed-upon files, applications, services, and system functions common to Windows OS and central to core operations.\nIn 2007, NIST evolved the FDCC into the\nUnited States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB)\n, largely to accommodate Windows 7.

Why the concern?\nAt least three victims of VanHelsing have already been identitified, and a number of variants of the malware have been analysed by security researchers. The fact that VanHelsing runs as a RaaS operation means that the problem could become significantly worse.\nRemind me again, what is RaaS?\nRaaS stands for ransomware-as-a-service. The criminals behind VanHelsing lease out their tools and infrastructure to \"affiliates\" who will launch the attacks, and then share a slice of the money they extort with the VanHelsing operators.\nCan anyone become a VanHelsing affiliate?\nNewcomers to the ransomware scene will need to pay a US $5,000 deposit, but if you are an established cybercriminal you may be allowed to skip payment. VanHelsing affiliates can keep 80% of the ransom payments they extort from their victims - leaving 20% to VanHelsing's operators.\n80% sounds like a good deal...\nYes, and this is one of the reasons why the VanHelsing ransomware is a concern. The rich rewards may encourage many more attacks by affiliates against unprepared organisations. I hope you're not tempted!\nNo, of course not. But are there any rules about being an affiliate?\nThe one main rule is that VanHelsing affiliates are strictly banned from targeting computer systems in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).\nSo attacking CIS countries with VanHelsing is forbidden?\nCorrect. CIS member countries are all allied with Russia, and include a number of former Soviet republics:\nArmenia\nAzerbaijan\nBelarus\nKazakhstan\nKyrgyzstan\nMoldova\nRussia\nTajikistan\nUzbekistan\nWhy would the VanHelsing affiliates banned from attacking these countries?\nWhy do you think?\nOh!

According to reports, attackers often exploit compromised credentials to move laterally within an organization, escalating their privileges to access critical systems.\nThere are several reasons why PAWs are critical:\nProtection Against Credential Theft: PAWs cut the risk of malicious actors harvesting credentials through phishing or keylogging on compromised machines by isolating privileged tasks.\nCompliance with Regulations: Many regulations mandate stringent controls for privileged access, particularly for entities that handle sensitive data, such as financial services and healthcare.

It lets you see which vulnerabilities are most attractive to attackers and make wise decisions with your resources instead of blindly fixing anything amiss without the bigger picture. It lets you preserve business operations while strategizing the most important remediations.\nFurthermore, it continues this virtuous cycle until your posture is far more advanced, intelligent, and autonomous than one using patch management alone.\nWhat Vulnerability Management Is – And Isn’t\nVulnerability management is more than just getting alerts whenever your infrastructure needs a patch applied. Vulnerability management is about making informed decisions and properly prioritizing what vulnerabilities to mitigate and how. This is achieved by embedding internal hooks for telemetry into all systems of interest as well as external hooks for threat intelligence from all sources.\nTo be effective, a vulnerability management program has to be backed up by good threat intelligence that provides a deeper understanding of how and why threat actors are targeting certain vulnerabilities and ignoring others. Intelligence on vulnerability exploitability prepares your organization to strike the correct balance between patching vulnerable systems and interrupti"

One way to protect sensitive data is through PII masking e.g., consistently changing names or including only the last four digits of a credit card or Social Security Number.\nWhat is data masking?\nData masking replaces sensitive columns in the source data with realistic test data. A data breach remediation strategy is primarily used to address areas of risk. By preserving the integrity and usability of the original, it creates an unidentifiable and secure version.\nMasking is usually needed for the following types of data:\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, email addresses, social security, and telephone numbers\nProtected Health Information (PHI) such as patient name, insurance details, diagnostic information, and medical history.\nThe Payment Card Industry (PCI) is concerned with protecting consumers' financial information by the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC)\n.\nData masking is often used in non-production environments, such as software development, data science, testing, and training. Tools and processes mask sensitive data to make it unrecognizable while maintaining its functionality for authorized users.\nData Masking Process\nIterative data masking consists of five steps: data discovery, defining masking rules, assigning masking rules, deploying masking functionality, and auditing the entire process.\nImage\nThe data masking process starts with:\nDiscover the data and its relationships: Your data masking tools or process should import the metadata data and be able to discover, analyze, and visualize the sensitive data within the data sources.\nDefine the data masking rules: Based on the masking requirements, you should be able to define dynamic masking rules (restricting access to sensitive data with\nRole-Based Access Controls (RBAC)\n) and persistent data mask"

        "raw_content": "Image\nIt is a significant benefit that the world is connected the way it is, with the potential for even greater interconnectivity. However, this has come at huge costs, too, considering the rise in the direct involvement of state actors engaged in cyber warfare. Against this background, nations have a more acute awareness of digital vulnerabilities, which has radiated into regulatory frameworks concerning cross-border data compliance. Beyond security, privacy, freedom of information, and other legal and ethical factors are also important considerations.\nHow National Security Concerns Have Shaped Data Governance\nNational security concerns have fundamentally altered the way governments and businesses approach data compliance, forcing a shift from an almost exclusive focus on individual privacy rights to a more complex balancing act with national security imperatives.\nExpansion of Government Access\n: In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, US national security priorities inspired legislation such as the Patriot Act. The Act dramatically expanded law enforcement’s authority to access data held by private companies. One can trace the line from such actions to recent US actions to\nrestrict cross-border transfers of bulk sensitive data\nto adversary nations like China, Russia, and Iran.\nData Localization\n: Beyond the US, several countries have been driven to adopt data localization policies; governments are tightening their hold on data generated within their national borders. For instance, China’s Personal Information Protection Law requires data generated on their soil to be stored domestically. Similarly, the provisions of the EU’s GDPR have extraterritorial applications.\nNational Security Exemptions\n: Frameworks like the GDPR were originally designed to protect personal privacy but eventually included broad exemptions for national security purposes. Expectedly, these exemptions also vary by country. This has caused businesses to design processes that account for potential gov"

        "raw_content": "Scammers are highly resourceful and cunning when devising new ways to swindle people. But they often rely on long-standing persuasion techniques for their tricks to work. So, you may hear about a new scam that uses a novel narrative, but there is a good chance that the scam depends on proven scam techniques once the narrative is stripped away.\nBut first, what constitutes a scam? A scam is when someone deceptively attempts to get money, data, or personal information from you under false pretenses. They do so with methods including\nsocial engineering\n, emails (phishing) and text messages (smishing), often posing as legitimate companies, governmental agencies, or even real people from your life in order to create a false sense of trust.\nTo Err is Human\nThese scam techniques often exploit our characteristics and heuristics, the very things that make us human and fallible. A malefactor may use a variety of techniques to pressure people into acting against their own best interests, but each of these techniques will use emotion to cloud the target's judgement.\nIn this blog post, we will cover some of the following common scam techniques and explain how they work:\nEvoking visceral influence\nCreating urgency\nExploiting the fear of missing out (FOMO)\nAppealing to authority\nFaking social proof\nAppealing to reciprocity\nLeveraging the bandwagon effect\nAppealing to emotions of guilt or sympathy\nNormalizing risky behavior\nExploiting trust in experts\nThe Stick and Carrot\nEvoking visceral influences such as hunger, thirst, pain, fear, excitement, sexual desire, greed, and suchlike, are primal states that can powerfully guide behavior. People often focus entirely on addressing the immediate need when under such influence, compromising rational thinking. For example, we’re told not to shop for food when hungry because our judgment is clouded.\nScammers exploit this by triggering visceral states, such as fear (a compromised account) or excitement or greed (a free prize).
