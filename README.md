🛡️ Aetheris Platform - Complete Architecture

  Let me walk you through how your cybersecurity intelligence platform works from start to finish:

  🔄 The Complete Data Journey

  Phase 1: Data Collection

  🌐 Cybersecurity News Websites
      ↓
  🕷️ Web Crawlers (Scrapy + BeautifulSoup)
      ↓
  📄 Raw Articles stored in Django DB

  What happens:
  - Scrapy spiders crawl security news sites automatically
  - BeautifulSoup extracts article content from RSS feeds
  - Articles stored with metadata (title, content, source, timestamp)

  Phase 2: Vector Database Creation

  📄 Raw Articles
      ↓
  🔤 TF-IDF Vectorizer converts text → numbers
      ↓
  ⚡ FAISS creates searchable vector index
      ↓
  💾 Stored as binary files in /faiss/ folder

  What FAISS does:
  - Converts text into 5000-dimensional vectors
  - Creates lightning-fast similarity search index
  - Finds related articles in milliseconds
  - Like Google search but for threat intelligence

  Phase 3: AI Classification

  📄 Articles
      ↓
  🧠 Gemini LLM analyzes content
      ↓
  🏷️ Extracts 30+ threat taxonomy fields
      ↓
  💾 GeneratedTaxonomyLabel database

  AI extracts:
  - Threat severity (critical/high/medium)
  - Affected platforms (Windows/Linux/etc)
  - Attack vectors and MITRE tactics
  - Geographic and industry context

  Phase 4: Synthetic Enterprise Data

  🏢 Faker library generates realistic data
      ↓
  📊 Active Directory, CMDB, Employee records
      ↓
  💾 Django models simulate real enterprise

  Creates fake but realistic:
  - 1000s of employees across departments
  - IT assets (servers, laptops, firewalls)
  - Active Directory structure with users/groups
  - Security logs from various tools

  💬 How Chat Works (The Magic)

  When you ask: "Are there any new threat news over the last 24 hours?"

  Step 1: Query Understanding

  👤 "threats in last 24 hours"
      ↓
  🕒 Extract time filter → Past 24 hours
  🔍 Extract keywords → "threats", "news"
  📍 Extract location/dept → None specified

  Step 2: Vector Search

  🔤 Convert query to TF-IDF vector
      ↓
  ⚡ Search FAISS index for similar articles
      ↓
  📅 Filter results by timestamp (last 24h)
      ↓
  📄 Return top 5 most relevant articles

  Step 3: Asset Correlation

  📄 Analyze article content for keywords
      ↓ (finds "Palo Alto", "GlobalProtect", "VPN")
  🏢 Search CMDB for matching assets
      ↓ (finds firewalls, VPN gateways)
  📊 Return potentially affected infrastructure

  Step 4: Intelligence Generation

  📝 Build comprehensive prompt with:
     - Recent threat articles
     - Affected asset inventory
     - Organizational context
     - Source attribution
      ↓
  🧠 Send to Gemini LLM
      ↓
  📊 Receive structured threat analysis

  Step 5: Response Formatting

  📊 AI Response includes:
     - Summary of threats
     - Specific affected assets table
     - Threat actor analysis
     - Actionable remediation steps
     - Source attribution
